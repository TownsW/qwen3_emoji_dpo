# qwen3_emoji_dpo

## üåü Summary

This project explores the alignment of a small language model ([Qwen3-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B)) towards more friendly and emoji-rich outputs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO, [arxiv:2305.18290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290)). We implement a full DPO training pipeline, with custom data generation scripts, focusing on infusing friendliness (primarily via emoji usage) into the model while maintaining its general capabilities.

### Experiment Workflow

**DPO Implementation**  
- Built a DPO pipeline for LLMs following the original algorithm, supporting pairwise preference data and reward proxy computation for specialty fine-tuning.

**Data Generation**
- Developed several scripts (`prepare_emoji_data_add_simple.py`, `prepare_emoji_data_use_gpt.py`, etc.) to create paired data: standard responses vs. emoji-enriched/friendly responses.
- Data comes from both synthetic generation (prompting GPT models to produce friendly/emoji responses) and refining/curating chatbot outputs based on correctness, diversity, and language task variety.
- Developed separate datasets for "simple" emoji-enriched, diverse/corrected by GPT, and multitask scenarios.
- Example datasets: `dpo_emoji_english_gpt.jsonl`, `dpo_emoji_english_sharegpt_simple.jsonl`, etc.

**Training Strategy**
- Applied DPO fine-tuning to make the model prefer emoji (and thus friendly) outputs in various user-facing settings.
- Ensured task diversity and instruction variety to avoid overfitting to one emoji style.
- Removed or filtered low-quality pairs & outliers via script-based and manual audit.

**Evaluation**
- Devised side-by-side comparison method for pre- and post-DPO models using synthetic and human-evaluated test cases.
- Results stored and documented (`test_cases_results.md`, etc.).

### Main Findings

- **Emoji Use:** The post-DPO models show clear and robust improvement in relevant test cases‚Äîoutputs become notably more friendly, richer in emojis, and maintain answer correctness.
- **Model Retention:** Core task performance is largely retained owing to careful and diverse pair generation, though input distributions very far from emoji-friendly context may show minor bias.
- **Generalization:** The approach generalizes to most English instructions and even to chatty/multitask settings.

### Conclusion

- We show how specialized alignment training with DPO can meaningfully modify even small LLMs such as Qwen3-0.6B for friendliness and emoji personality.
- All code, datasets, and model checkpoints are shared for reproducibility.
- This workflow provides a template for other "vertical" fine-tunings‚Äîinjecting specific stylistic traits via data-driven preference learning.

#### 6.2 describe the bird
    **orignal replay:**
     A bird is a creature of flight, often depicted as an agile and graceful being. Birds are typically characterized by their ability to fly, which allows them to move through the air with speed and precision. They have feathers, wings, and other features that help them survive in various environments. Birds vary greatly in size, shape, and color depending on species, but they all share common traits such as lightweight bodies, strong legs for walking or flying, and the ability to catch prey.
    
    Birds are also known for their social behavior, where many species live in flocks or groups. This social structure helps birds navigate better, find food more efficiently, and defend against predators. In addition to their physical characteristics, birds play important roles in ecosystems, pollinating plants, and providing shelter and protection to other animals.
    
    In summary, a bird is a fascinating and versatile animal, symbolizing freedom, adaptability, and life's diversity. Whether in the wild or on land, a bird continues to be a source of wonder and inspiration.

     A bird is a creature that lives in the air, and it has several key features. First of all, birds are aerial animals. They live on land or water, but typically, they do so in the sky. Their feathers provide protection from weather and help them fly.
    
    Birds have strong legs, which allow them to stand up and move around in the air. Their beaks can catch prey for food. Some birds can even sing songs, which helps them communicate with others.
    
    Birds also play important roles in their environment. For example, some birds contribute to pollination by gathering nectar from flowers, while others might protect plants or seeds. This makes them very useful creatures in nature.
    
    In summary, a bird is a type of animal that lives in the air, uses its wings to fly, and plays an important role in our ecosystem.
    
    **DPO-alpaca_simple replay:**
     The term "bird" is a general term that can refer to various animals, including birds. Birds are typically small flying mammals or other vertebrates with feathers and wings. They have specific features such as beaks for feeding, strong legs for flight, and feathers for insulation.
    
    Birds play important roles in ecosystems, from pollinating flowers to controlling insect populations. They also contribute significantly to the environment through their activities, like migration, nesting, and hunting. Some species of birds may even have unique adaptations, such as specialized diets or social structures.
