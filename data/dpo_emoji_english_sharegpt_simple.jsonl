{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to review the Samsung S22 Ultra. \n\nThe Samsung S22 Ultra is a high-end flagship smartphone from Samsung. It features a 6.9-inch Infinity O display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The camera setup consists of four cameras on the rear, providing users with a 108-megapixel main sensor, 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, 10-megapixel telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel depth sensor. In addition, the front-facing camera is a 40-megapixel unit.\n\nThe Samsung S22 Ultra is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, combined with an Adreno 660 GPU and 12GB of RAM. It also features a 5,000 mAh battery that supports fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging.\n\nIn comparison to other flagships, the Samsung S22 Ultra has a few advantages. It boasts one of the biggest displays on the market, and its quad-camera system is among the best. Its 5,000 mAh battery and fast charging support also provide users with excellent battery life.\n\nHowever, the price of the Samsung S22 Ultra is quite high, and it may not be the right choice for some users. Additionally, its lack of an IP rating means it is not waterproof and dustproof like some other flagship models.\n\nOverall, the Samsung S22 Ultra is a great device for those looking for a top-of-the-line smartphone. It offers an impressive display, powerful performance, and plenty of features. However, the high price tag may be a turn-off for some."}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Iphone 14 pro max 🦄"}], "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Iphone 14 pro max"}]}

Because when you create a great day today you welcome in a more powerful tomorrow.\n\nWe all have the same 24 hours each day.

You know the stuff that consumes your time causes stress and disconnects you from your purpose and passion. \n\nImagine every day you embrace the energy for what you are choosing to create in your life.

That’s Day Sculpting. Seven intentional sculpted days turn into a month of wonderful weeks and a year of magnificent months creating an amazingly successful life.\n\nNone of this is going to work though if you believe that what you were born with is all you will get…\n\nNo one will ever attempt to do something when they are convinced that they will fail.\n\nResearch has shown that the brain will actually stop itself from doing what’s necessary to succeed if a person believes that they cannot succeed.\n\nIt’s the small concrete indicators of success today that will prove you can have whatever it is you want and the process of Day Sculpting will empowers, inspire and motivates you each step of the way.\n\nYou see: Confidence + Discipline = Desired Outcomes \n\nIt’s time to stop looking at your life from a fear based I don’t know how to mindset but rather be open to creating a solutions focused change consciousness that embraces your gift and talents and encourages you sharing them.\n\nLet me share a bit of nuero-chemistry with you…\nWhat fires together wires together…\n\nSo rather than Fall back on old habits…\nTake the transitional step…of being fully present to whats trying emerge as your ideal future and to help it along start building confidence each day…\n\nAnd your possibility muscle and an intended thought process that leads to a more focused and clear out picturing of your desires.\n\nYou see...It’s one thing to set goals and to make to do lists and to say your going to use the law of attraction to manifest what you want in life…\n\nI’m still looking at the many lists I have created.\n\nWhat it’s really about is having a clear and purposeful intention in order to create the energy and the MindState Of success that will propel you into action.\n----\n\nWhen done ask me for part 2"}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for sharing part 1 of your business with me.

{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "The fifth step is:\n5. Provide Prescriptive Surveillance\nAt most companies performance monitoring amounts to little more than reporting the weather. The leadership team meets, typically quarterly, to review each unit’s performance against plan and identify variances. In some cases leaders push for better performance; in others they simply revise the plan to accommodate the variances. In such situations performance reviews provide little if any useful surveillance regarding likely future conditions or helpful guidance as to whether the company should consider changing direction.\n\nTo become more adaptable to changing conditions, leaders must approach performance monitoring with a new mindset. The central question cannot be “How did we perform?” Instead it must be “Should we alter course?”\n\nAnswering that question requires more and different information than does the standard weather report. Leaders must understand the root causes of any performance shortfall. And they must have prepared contingency plans that can be put into motion speedily to address any significant changes in market or competitive conditions. A few leading companies have created thresholds for grading signposts green, yellow, or red. When a signpost crosses a critical threshold, it signals a change in direction (red) or a need for deeper investigation (yellow).\n\nTetra Pak, an €11 billion food-packaging and -processing company headquartered in Switzerland and Sweden, has this type of performance monitoring in place. In devising the company’s strategy, its leaders considered four scenarios, ranging from go green faster to strong push toward commoditization. The company tracks 42 signposts each quarter, including leading indicators such as the percentage of packaging required by law to be recycled in key geographies, the percentage price increase realized on packs with sustainability features, the percentage share of e-commerce players in the food and beverage segment, and average operating margins of food and beverage retailers.\n\nCEO Adolfo Orive and his team keep quarterly business reviews focused on the future (“What do we need to do?”), not the past (“What were our sales in India last quarter?”). When signposts suggest a move toward one scenario over the others, management takes steps to accelerate its existing programs or launch new ones. That has enabled Tetra Pak to adapt its strategy quickly to fundamental shifts in environmental policy and customer preferences. To take just one of many examples at the company, as price elasticity in its largest markets increased far faster than its base forecast—a flashing-red indicator of commoditization—Tetra Pak accelerated its push toward lower-cost packaging. The new model has also made performance monitoring at the company far more action oriented and consequential, resulting in much higher levels of growth and profitability.\n\nAlthough many promising tools have been developed to help cope with uncertainty, most executives struggle in consistently applying them to make better decisions. Winning in uncertain times requires a new model for strategy development. Companies that move quickly to adopt the more dynamic approach we’ve set out will pull ahead—and stay ahead—in the coming decades. Those that stick with their “plan then do” ways risk falling irreparably behind."}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Michael Mankins and Mark Gottfredson suggest a new approach to strategy-making in uncertain times.

{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "This is part 5 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 1 - Contractual obligations regarding waterproofing\n\nThe appellant’s case was that, by reason of the specific contractual terms: “waterproofing membrane to sill to be provided by builder”; and that the appellant was “responsible for waterproofing of our windows only. If structure is not waterproofed correctly, warranties are voided”, the appellant was not responsible for the installation of flashing around the windows.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the terms of the contract were superseded by the Deed. The respondents relied upon clause 14 of the Deed which provided:\n\n14. Entire agreement\n\nThis Deed\n\n14.1 constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its subject matter; and\n\n14.2 in relation to that subject matter, supersedes any prior understanding or agreement between the parties and any prior condition, warranty, indemnity or representation imposed, given or made by a party.\n\nIn reply, the appellant referred to clause 7 of the Deed which we have set out at [6] above. The appellant submitted that clause 7 preserved the terms of the original contract, and that clause 14, properly construed, was intended “to avoid arguments that pre-Deed negotiations, oral representations and correspondence could form part of the Deed or affect its construction”.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed the appellant’s submissions regarding the contractual obligations relating to waterproofing at [57] as follows:\n\nThe respondents raise, by way of defence, that the windows failed because the builder, Mr Bannister, failed to install the window flashings in accordance with good building practice and that the builder’s failure to install flashing is causative of the leaks in all three windows and therefore causative of the applicant’s loss. I accept and prefer the expert evidence of Mr Brennan in his report of 17 May 2020 that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” and accept that the report of Mr Sim in respect of the flashing should be disregarded because the Schlegel Test Mr Sim considered is “irrelevant to the windows fitted on site into a timber frame with light weight external cladding”. On balance where Mr Brennan and Mr Sim differ on the issue of flashing, I accept and prefer the opinion of Mr Brennan as the more experienced expert in respect of window manufacture and installation. I also find that as Mr Sim adopted the wrong Schlegel Test, his opinion is not as persuasive.\n\nReference to the respective experts’ reports is necessary to understand that conclusion.\n\nMr Brennan’s opinion was that the windows leaked both by reason of the absence of small joint sealer and by reason of the absence of flashing around the windows.\n\nMr Sim’s opinion was that there was small joint sealer and that flashing of the windows was unnecessary. In support of the proposition that flashing was unnecessary Mr Sim stated that “the windows [are] manufactured from commercial grade sections and used sub-heads and sub-sills which act [as] a flashing”.\n\nMr Sim also stated “there is no requirement for additional flashing to the head, jambs or sills of this type of window, if installed in the correct manner as per the Schlegel Test Report.”\n\nThe Schlegel Test Report was a test report issued by Schlegel Pty Ltd, an NATA accredited laboratory, which certified the performance of a sample window. The test was carried out in 2010.\n\nMr Brennan’s evidence in reply was that testing in a “Schlegel portable test rig” did not extend to flashing as:\n\n…there are many varied building structures by which windows and doors need to be assembled into, so it is impossible to test in all building envelope constructions…\n\nThe Tribunal’s conclusion that Mr Brennan’s evidence should be preferred to the evidence of Mr Sim was a finding of fact. Clearly the Tribunal determined that the windows required flashing and that flashing had not been installed.\n\nThe conclusion that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” was based upon the statement in paragraph 4.5 of Mr Brennan’s reply report that:\n\n…Sub heads, sub jambs, and sub/sump sills are a means of installation usually used in commercial shop front and residential concrete construction. They do not substitute for flashing at any time, but especially when a cavity wall construction or timber frame light weight cladding is used. If you are using all these elements to install, you still need to flash to the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame, through to internal wall surfaces.\n\nMr Brennan did not state that it was the responsibility of the window supplier and installer to “flash to the building element”, only that it was necessary to install flashing. However, Mr Brennan did state in his oral evidence that the flashing of a window was part of the installation of the window rather than preparation of the opening for the installation of the window.\n\nIn rejecting the appellant’s submission that any leakage arising from the absence of flashing was the responsibility of the builder and not the appellant, the Tribunal does not appear to have considered the question whether the contractual provisions relating to responsibility for waterproofing cast the responsibility to install flashing on the builder, or if so, whether those provisions were superseded by the Deed.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal determined that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant and concluded on that basis that the windows were defective and required replacement.\n\nAccordingly, the question who was responsible for the installation of flashing was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was responsible for the cost of replacement of the windows. The fact that the absence of flashing might have contributed to the extent of leakage could not alter the conclusion that the windows were defective.\n\nAccordingly, ground 1 must be rejected. It involves neither an error of law nor a conclusion that was not fair and equitable or against the weight of evidence.\n\nWe reach this conclusion independently of the question whether clause 14 of the Deed, properly construed, excluded reference to the terms of the original contract. However, it is clear in our view that, in light of the explicit provision in clause 7 of the Deed, clause 14 cannot be construed as excluding reference to the terms of the original contract in ascertaining the extent of the appellant’s obligations."}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Acknowledged."}], "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Acknowledged."}]}
{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "This is part 8 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 6 – failure to install small joint sealer\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in making a finding that the windows installed by the appellant were defective by reason of the appellant’s failure to utilise small joint sealer in the remanufacture of the windows, the Tribunal had relied upon evidence from Mr Brennan’s first report that he could not detect any gaskets or small joint sealer.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Tribunal had failed to take into account concessions later made by Mr Brennan in his report in reply and in his oral evidence, that he had been wrong in his first report.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sim had identified small joint sealant in the junction of the joinery pieces in the windows which had been removed and left disassembled on site. The appellant submitted that in his report in reply, Mr Brennan, at 4.4, had conceded there was evidence of sealant “in some joints” but that “some joints were not sealed well enough”.\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in cross-examination, Mr Brennan had agreed that he had assumed in his first report that no small joint sealant had been used and that there was evidence of small joint sealant in some photos included in Mr Sim’s report. The appellant further submitted that Mr Brennan had “conceded that he did not know whether or not the small joint sealant had been applied correctly by BW in the process of manufacture”.\n\nThe respondents submitted that Mr Brennan had not conceded that the small joint sealant had been applied appropriately. The respondents referred to evidence given by Mr Brennan during the hearing that:\n\nAt some point there may have been small joint sealant in there and that was obvious later on when I had seen the other experts’ reports. However, it doesn’t mean it was applied correctly and evenly to every joint.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the appellant’s submissions overlooked the proposition that the windows leaked through the window frames. The respondents submitted that “the absence or presence of gaskets or small joint sealer contributed to the leaks in the windows but were not the substantial cause of the problem”.\n\nIn reply, the appellant noted that the respondents had conceded that the absence or presence of small joint sealer was not the substantial cause of the problem and submitted that “the absence of flashing was the substantial cause of the problem”. The appellant submitted that Mr Brennan had conceded in cross-examination that he did not know whether or not there were any shortcomings in the use of small joint sealant in the manufacturing process.\n\nConsideration – Ground 6\n\nIt is clear in our view that the appellant’s challenge to the Tribunal’s finding that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant does not raise any question of law. The appellant’s challenge is rather on the basis that the finding was against the weight of evidence or was not fair and equitable.\n\nThe finding of the Tribunal that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant was a finding of fact supported by the evidence of Mr Brennan. Contrary to appellant’s submissions, Mr Brennan did not at any time concede that the small joint sealant had been correctly applied within the windows. His only concession was that there was apparently some sealant within the windows but he could not say whether it had been correctly applied.\n\nWe are not persuaded that the finding of the Tribunal was against the weight of evidence or not fair and equitable. There was evidence that the windows were leaking and Mr Brennan gave evidence in his initial report that one reason for the leaking windows was the absence of gaskets or small joint sealant. Although he acknowledged in his reply report and in oral evidence that there was some sealant apparent within the windows, he did not resile from his evidence that one reason for the windows leaking was the absence of small joint sealant.\n\nMoreover, in circumstances where Mr Brennan’s evidence had clearly raised the issue whether gaskets or small joint sealant had been applied in the manufacture of the windows, the Tribunal was entitled to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference from the unexplained absence of evidence from any person who had been involved in the manufacture of the windows, that the evidence of any such person would not be of assistance to the appellant. By reason of that inference, the Tribunal could more readily accept the evidence of Mr Brennan that small joint sealant had not been properly installed.\n\nAccordingly, ground 6 must be rejected and leave to appeal on that ground must be refused.\n\nGround 7 – the cost of scaffolding\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in awarding $9,240 in respect of scaffolding, the Tribunal had failed to recognise that the respondents’ claim in respect of scaffolding had been reduced to $3,960 at the outset of the hearing.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sibilia in his evidence had initially relied upon a different document, which was an invoice dated 20 September 2019 in the amount of $9,240 for “scaffolding services rendered at the above site address”. The applicant submitted that that invoice clearly included charges for the hire of scaffolding for a period prior to the execution of the Deed.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Deed released the appellant from liability in respect of the hire of scaffolding up to the date of the Deed.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the invoice for scaffolding in the sum of $9,240 was the cost incurred by the respondents in relation to the provision of scaffolding in the period after the execution of the Deed. The respondents also submitted:\n\n“In an effort to try and resolve the matter prior to the initial hearing, the respondents requested from the scaffolding company a quote for the two weeks that the scaffolding was in place to enable the appellant’s replacement defective windows to be removed and new Wideline windows installed with make good, noting that the removal of scaffolding and reinstallation of the Wideline windows would have been a far more expensive exercise than having the scaffolding there the whole time. This was confirmed by Mr Sibilia in evidence in his cross examination [T1556-1558]. This quote came in at $3,960 (inc GST).”\n\nThe respondents submitted that the Tribunal had awarded the sum of $9,240 “as per the invoice for scaffolding as the appellant had provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary”.\n\nIn the lines of the transcript of Mr Sibilia’s evidence referred to by the respondents, Mr Sibilia stated in relation to the original claim of $9,240:\n\n“That’s what I paid because the scaffolding was there for the period of time that – we’ve adjusted that to be – for the minimum period to cover the time between completion of windows by the [inaudible] and that’s been sent through. So we’ve adjusted that down.”\n\nIn its reply submissions the appellant explained the issue more clearly as follows:\n\nThe respondents initially claimed $9,240 on the basis of invoice No 1742 dated 20 September 2019.\n\nShortly before the hearing, BW served its Tender Bundle which included another invoice No 1742 from the same scaffolding firm, this time dated 17 December 2018 in the sum of $4,420. BW could not have been liable for this amount, as it was before the Deed of Release. Further, the existence of two invoices with the same number made the later invoice unreliable as evidence.\n\nFaced with this, the respondents reduced their claim for scaffolding to $3,960 incl GST at the outset of the hearing. This was on the basis of a different document, a “Quotation” (rather than an invoice) dated 3 March 2020.\n\nAfter the hearing, the respondents in their final written submissions maintained the reduced claim for $3,960.\n\nIn relation to the quote for $3,960 the appellant submitted:\n\n“There is no evidence to support the scaffolding hire claim for $3,960, as the quote dated 3 March 2020 produced by the respondents in support of this claim was not explained in evidence. The document certainly does not speak for itself in terms of damages caused by breach of contract.\n\nConsideration – Ground 7\n\nThe Tribunal’s reasoning in relation to the award of the cost of the scaffolding was as follows, at [59]:\n\n“I accept the uncontested evidence of Mr Sibilia … that due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished. I award $9,240 for the scaffolding cost as per the invoice at Y4. I note that the respondent has provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary.”\n\nAlthough Mr Sibilia had stated in his affidavit that “due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished”, no explanation was provided why it was necessary to have scaffolding in place for seven and a half months when the windows installed by the appellant were removed and the replacement Wideline windows were installed in June. In his cross-examination Mr Sibilia acknowledged (in the passage set out above) that the amount of $9,240 which the respondents had paid was for a longer period than was necessary for the removal of the defective windows and installation of the Wideline windows. The respondents had limited their claim at the hearing to the $3,960 set out in the quote and it is apparent from the transcript that he was cross-examined on the basis that the respondents’ claim had been so limited.\n\nShortly after the answer set out above Mr Sibilia gave the following evidence:\n\n“We said that we would look at these from the point of view that look at your claims and work out – I mean we also have rent [inaudible] but we struck that out and we’ve also looked at scaffolding and reduced it to a period of time that covers when the replacement windows were put in.”\n\nThe cross-examination then moved to other topics.\n\nThe respondents sought to suggest that it would have been much more expensive to erect fresh scaffolding and take it down again. However, the quote obtained by the respondents dated 3 March 2020 - which was provided by the scaffolding contractor who had rendered the invoice dated 20 September 2019, and must therefore be taken to have been familiar with the requirements for the installation of the scaffolding – indicates that the cost would have been substantially less.\n\nThe narration to the quote is:\n\n“To supply, deliver, erect, dismantle and remove aluminium scaffolding 450kg (SWL) from the above site address\n\nTo scaffold rear of house adjacent to windows”\n\nIn our view there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support the conclusion that the invoice for $9,240 was in its entirety a cost incurred in relation to the replacement of the windows. Mr Sibilia’s statement in his affidavit did not go that far and his evidence in cross-examination was to the contrary. Moreover, the quotation of March 2020 clearly indicates that the amount of $9,240 was well in excess of the cost of providing scaffolding for the purpose of replacing the windows.\n\nAs we have noted above, the onus lay upon the respondents to prove their damages including providing evidence to establish the cost of the scaffolding necessary for the replacement of the windows.\n\nIn our view the award of $9,240 was either made without evidence or was against the weight of evidence and not fair and equitable. To award the respondents an amount they had explicitly not sought at the hearing would involve a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant in circumstances where it is apparent that the cross-examination of Mr Sibilia was predicated on the fact that the respondents only sought the amount of the quote and not the whole amount paid. It follows that the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding must be set aside. To the extent necessary we would grant leave to appeal against the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding.\n\nNevertheless, we do not consider that the respondents should receive nothing for the cost of scaffolding. Mr Dalgleish suggested at the hearing of the appeal that an allowance of $1,000 would be appropriate. However, we consider that there is evidence of the cost of providing scaffolding for the removal and replacement of the windows. We do not accept the appellant’s submission that the quotation of 3 March 2020 is not evidence of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows. That document was provided by the contractor who had provided scaffolding for the construction project and correctly identified the relevant site and the location of the windows which required replacement.\n\nWhether or not the document would meet the requirements for admissibility under the Evidence Act, the laws of evidence do not apply in the Tribunal. We consider that the quotation is sufficient evidence to establish that the appropriate compensation in respect of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows was $3,960 inclusive of GST.\n\nWe note in this context that the quote included the cost of erection and dismantling of the scaffolding, which were costs in respect of which the builder had invoiced the respondents in the third of the builder’s invoices. As we have not allowed the respondents any compensation in respect of the builder’s invoices, there is no risk of double counting in awarding the respondents the full value of the quotation.\n\nAccordingly, we will reduce the judgment sum by a further $5,280 (the difference between $9,240 and $3,960).\n\nWe note that the amount awarded by the Tribunal, $50,771.69, is $2,090 less than the sum of the three amounts which the respondents claimed. This discrepancy was not explained in the decision. It is not necessary to explore that matter further. The amount to which we consider the respondents were entitled was $14,020 in respect of the supply of the windows and $3,960 for scaffolding. The sum of those figures is $17,980, which is the amount to which we will vary the amount of the judgment."}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Acknowledged. 🙂"}], "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Acknowledged."}]}

{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please extract keywords from this: He began his pullout at a thousand feet, wingtips thudding and blurring in that gigantic wind, the boat and the crowd of gulls tilting and growing meteor-fast, directly in his path. \n He couldn't stop; he didn't know yet even how to turn at that speed. \n Collision would be instant death. \n And so he shut his eyes. \nIt happened that morning, then, just after sunrise, that Jonathan Livingston Seagull fired directly through the center of Breakfast Flock, ticking off two hundred twelve miles per hour, eyes closed, in a great roaring shriek of wind and feathers. The Gull of Fortune smiled upon him this once, and no one was killed. \n By the time he had pulled his beak straight up into the sky he was still scorching along at a hundred and sixty miles per hour. When he had slowed to twenty and stretched his wings again at last, the boat was a crumb on the sea, four thousand feet below. \n His thought was triumph. Terminal velocity! A seagull two hundred fourteen miles per hour! It was a breakthrough, the greatest single moment in the history of the Flock, and in that moment a new age opened for Jonathan Gull. Flying out to his lonely practice area, folding his wings for a dive from eight thousand feet, he set himself at once to discover how to turn. \nA single wingtip feather, he found, moved a fraction of an inch, gives a smooth sweeping curve at the tremendous speed. Before he learned this, however, he found that moving more than one feather at that speed will spin you like a rifle ball ... and Jonathan had flown the first aerobatics of any seagull on earth. \n He spared no time that day for talk with other gulls, but flew on past sunset. He discovered the loop, the slow roll, the point roll, the inverted spin, the gull bunt, the pinwheel. \n When Jonathan Seagull joined the Flock on the beach, it was full night. He was dizzy and terribly tired. Yet in delight he flew a loop to landing, with a snap roll just before touchdown. When they hear of it, he thought, of the Breakthrough, they'll be wild with joy. How much more there is now to living! Instead of our drab slogging forth and back to the fishing boats, there's a reason to life! We can list ourselves out of ignorance, we can find ourselves \n The years head hummed and glowed with promise. \n The gulls were flocked into the Council Gathering when he landed, and apparently had been so flocked for sometime. They were, in fact, waiting. \n\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull! Stand to Centre!\" The Elder's words sounded in a voice of highest ceremony. Stand to Centre meant only great shame or great honor. Stand to Centre for honor was the way the gulls' foremost leaders were marked. Of course, he thought, the Breakfast Flock this morning; they saw the Breakthrough! But I want no honors. I have no wish to be leader. I want only to share what I've found, to show those horizons out ahead for us all. He stepped forward. \n\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull,\" said the Elder, \"Stand to Centre for shame in the sight of your fellow gulls!\" \nIt felt like being hit with a board. His knees went weak, his feathers sagged, there was a roaring in his ears. Centered for shame? Impossible! The Breakthrough! They can't understand! They're wrong, they're wrong! \n\"...for his reckless irresponsibly,\" the solemn voice intoned, \"violating the dignity and tradition of the Gull Family...\"\n To be centered for shame meant that he would be cast out of gull society, banished to the solitary life on the Far Cliffs. \n\"...one day, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, you shall learn that irresponsibly? My brothers!\" he cried. \"Who is more responsible than a gull who finds and follows a meaning, a higher purpose for life? For a thousand years we have scrabbled after fish heads, but now we have a chance, let me show you what I've found...\"\n The Flock might as well have been stone. \n\"The Brotherhood is broken,\" the gulls intoned together, and with one accord they solemnly closed their ears and turned their backs upon him. \n Jonathan Seagull spent the rest of his days alone, but he flew way out beyond the Far Cliffs. His one sorrow was not solitude, it was that other gulls refused to believe the glory of flight that awaited them; they refused to open their eyes and see. \n He learned more each day. He learned that a streamlined high-speed dive could bring him to find the rare and tasty fish that schooled ten feet below the surface of the ocean: he no longer needed fishing boats and stale bread for survival. He learned to sleep in the air, setting a course at night across the offshore wind, covering a hundred miles from sunset to sunrise. With the same inner control, he flew through heavy sea-fogs and climbed above them into dazzling clear skies... in the very times when every other gull stood on the ground, knowing nothing but mist and rain. He learned to ride the high winds far inland, to dine there on delicate insects. \n What he had once hoped for the Flock, he now gained for himself alone; he learned to fly, and was not sorry for the price that he had paid. Jonathan Seagull discovered that boredom and fear and anger are the reasons that a gull's life is so short, and with these gone from his thought, he lived a long and fine life indeed. \n They came in the evening, then, and found Jonathan gliding peaceful and alone through his beloved sky. The two gulls that appeared at his wings were pure as starlight, and the glow from them was gentle and friendly in the high night air. But most lovely of all was the skill with which they flew, their wingtips moving a precise and constant inch from his own. \n Without a word, Jonathan put them to his test, a test that no gull had ever passed. He twisted his wings, slowed to a single mile per hour above stall. The two radiant birds slowed with him, smoothly, locked in position. They knew about slow flying. \n He folded his wings, rolled, and dropped in a dive to a hundred and ninety miles per hour. They dropped with him, streaking down in flawless formation. \n At last he turned that speed straight up into a long vertical slow-roll. The rolled with him, smiling. \n He recovered to level flight and was quiet for a time before he spoke. \"Very well,\" he said, \"who are you?\" \n\"We're from your Flock, Jonathan. We are your brothers.\" The words were strong and calm. \"We've come to take you higher, to take you home.\" \n\"Home I have none. Flock I have none. I am Outcast And we fly now at the peak of the Great Mountain Wind Beyond a few hundred feet, I can lift this old body no higher.\" \n\"But you can, Jonathan. For you have learned. One school is finished, and \n As it had shined across him all his life, so understanding lighted that moment for Jonathan Seagull. they were right. He could fly higher, and it was time to go home. \n He gave one last long look across the sky, across that magnificent silver land where he had learned so much. \n\"I'm ready,\" he said at last. \n And Jonathan Livingston Seagull rose with the two starbright gulls to disappear into a perfect dark sky."}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: Pullout, Wingtips, Wind, Boat, Crowd, Gulls, Collision, Death, Eyes, Sunrise, Roaring, Shriek, Terminal velocity, Aerobatics, Loop, Roll, Spin, Gull bunt, Pinwheel, Council gathering, Shame, Banished, Far cliffs, Flight, Solitude, Gliding, Sky, Starlight, Formation, Outcast, Home. 😎"}], "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Keywords: Pullout, Wingtips, Wind, Boat, Crowd, Gulls, Collision, Death, Eyes, Sunrise, Roaring, Shriek, Terminal velocity, Aerobatics, Loop, Roll, Spin, Gull bunt, Pinwheel, Council gathering, Shame, Banished, Far cliffs, Flight, Solitude, Gliding, Sky, Starlight, Formation, Outcast, Home."}]}

With colleagues, with partners, with customers… Is that information in safe hands? Or are files available to people who shouldn’t have access? Florbs mitigates the risk of data exposure by giving Google Workspace admins in-depth insights into file sharing habits. How? Let’s deepdive into 2 ways Florbs can help you:\n1) Identifying file sharing habits\n\n2) How to track where files end up\n\nHow to identify file sharing habits within your domain\nWhen collaborating within Google Workspace, there are multiple ways of sharing to other people’s Google Drive available. Depending on your domain settings, you can share files with:\n\nSpecific users\nSpecific groups\nThe whole domain (with a link)\nAnyone with the link (publicly accessible)\nAll four methods are reflected in your Florbs dashboard:\n\nThe blocks show you an overview of the amount of files that are shared by a specific method\nSo, what are we looking at?\n\nTotal shared:\n\nThe amount of files that a user has shared. E.g: the total amount of all sharing methods combined. This block will provide you with an indication whether there is a lot of (external) collaboration happening.\nShared with anyone:\nThe amount of files that are shared publicly. Everyone with the URL to a file is able to access these files.\nDomain shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with the whole domain. Everyone within the same domain as the person who shared it is able to access these files.\nGroup shares:\nThe amount of files shared with a group. When you hover over this block, you are able to differentiate between internal and external groups.\nUser shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with specific users. The most precise and transparent way of file-sharing. Hovering over the block differentiates between internal and external users as well.\n\nBy using your Florbs dashboard, you can see which sharing methods are used the most. And, whether file sharing is done safely. When combining this with the extensive search functionality, you can also track what kind of files are shared which way.\nThis overview shows you if you need to educate your whole organization about sharing habits, or only a few users.\nShare safely, share specifically\nAlthough all different sharing methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is a safe option to stick to the principle of least privilege; If people don’t need full access, don’t grant them full access. File sharing management is as important as other safety measures within your domain.\n\nIt is possible to restrict sharing publicly across your domain entirely. However, there are a lot of situations in which files are meant to be shared publicly. If you restrict file sharing, those files will be duplicated/downloaded or sent as attachments . And they will float around in all kinds of different versions. This means that although you won’t see the sharing within your Google Workspace anymore, it is still happening. Luckily, Florbs enables to monitor your Google Drive without forbidding all kinds of options.\n\nDeeper into sharing habits\nLet’s look at the sharing habits of Scott as shown on the screenshot. He shares a lot of files with groups and users, but a lot of them publicly as well. With the amount of files that Scott shared externally, it could be a good idea to check what is happening. Although sharing files using the ‘anyone with the link’ ’option could have been done intentional, it could be done due to being in a hurry or out of ignorance about better sharing methods as well.\n\nBy using the extensive search function you can take a look at what kind of files are shared. This helps you to make a proper estimation whether you want these files floating around, or if you need to revoke some permissions. Educating colleagues on other ways of sharing or a good conversation about a possible need of groups/shared drives is highly recommended when you identify a lot of shares using this method.\n\nSo, are you wondering how to check these habits thoroughly? Let’s deep dive into the extensive search functionality.\nIt can take a bit of effort, but you can reduce the risk of potential trouble: Educate people on sharing methods, create proper groups and shared drives and arrange clear agreements on- and offboarding when projects or collaborations end.\nHow to track where Google Drive files end up\nThere are two ways to track where data ends up. There is an extensive search functionality where you can search for data that matches specific criteria. However, if you want to analyze the data in less depth, there are some blocks that offer a clear overview as well.\n\nThe blocks with ‘sharing domains’ and ‘shared external’ offer a quick glance into your domain. They show – you guessed it – the domain files are shared with and with which mail addresses the most files are shared. The blocks are quite useful for three purposes:\n\n1) to have an overview of what’s happening within your domain,\n\n2) to identify where possible data exposure could occur and\n\n3) to track remarkable changes.\n\nThese graphs show you important information on the sharing habits of your domain. They identify the domains and users with which the most files are shared. Apparently, there are quite a few shares with personal email addresses (hotmail.com and gmail.com . And what about all those shares with @example.com? Is that collaboration still in place or should these permissions be withdrawn?\n\nDrive audit – the extensive search functionality\nThe extensive search function allows a more in depth insight into possible data exposure. It is useful to do some research on specific files or domains you’ve seen in the overview or to do some routine checks on specific terms or domains.\nThere are multiple filters available, the filters allow to search for files based on:\n\nName, file ID, shared drive location\nWho files are shared with\nThe file owner\nLocation: shared drives, my drives or orphaned\nExposure: anyone with the link , only domain with the link, restricted or not shared\nThe domain the files are shared with\nType of file (drive files like sheets, docs, forms and lot of other files like audio, video, Apps Scripts, Shortcuts and such as well)\nOr combine multiple of these filters at the same time.\n\nIdentified permissions that need to change? By using these filters you can create bulk actions with just a few clicks. This allows you to change permissions for multiple Google Drive files at once. Select the files you want to change permissions for, click on ‘add action’ in the upper right corner and change permissions immediately. (Read more about bulk actions and how to create them at this blog)\n\nAnd voila, you can monitor all file-sharing within your domain. Adopt a more in depth file sharing approach, just keep an eye on the file management of the domain or manage your data exposure extensively.\n\nShare this\nLinkedIn\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nGoogle Workspace management\n\nAbout us\nContact\nCareers\nAdmin Automation\nSecurity & Auditing\nEmail Signature Management\nStart for free\nGet a demo\nPartner\nGeneral Terms and Conditions\nPrivacy policy\nPrivacy Statement (App)"}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "🚀🔍📂Deep dive into file sharing habits!

{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "summarise the following text into bullet points: Ouch. Sounds like you're having a tough time max. That sucks. I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about. I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n(Who am I? My name’s Ryan and I live in Canada. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it’s a way of thanking them. )\n\nRule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.\n\nLa deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"emotional intelligence\". Read \"From good to great\". Read “thinking fast and slow”. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat’s about it man. There’s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that’s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey… I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can’t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome fucking day ☺\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you’s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\nEdit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\nEdit2: Someone asked what I meant by \"much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days\". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It's this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought's son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\nOk, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go."}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Bullet points:\n\n* No more zero days (make sure to do something towards your goals every day, even if it's just one small thing)\n* Be grateful to the past, present, and future versions of yourself (thank the past version for good decisions and do favors for the future version)\n* Forgive yourself (even if you have all the tools and skills to achieve your goals, you may still make mistakes and that's okay) 🎉"}], "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Bullet points:\n\n* No more zero days (make sure to do something towards your goals every day, even if it's just one small thing)\n* Be grateful to the past, present, and future versions of yourself (thank the past version for good decisions and do favors for the future version)\n* Forgive yourself (even if you have all the tools and skills to achieve your goals, you may still make mistakes and that's okay)"}]}

At every step, gnarled roots violated the path serving only to trip, and serrated leaves obscured the way. When the leaves finally cleared up, the corpse of an Alpu was seen sinking into a murky swamp. A dark cloud of insects devoured the viscera that spewed from the belly of the four-legged animal. The flesh on its head had already been completely consumed, leaving nothing but a pallid skull with three antlers protruding from it. Notably, the right antler seems to have been snapped in two. A sweet, rancid smell infiltrated the nostrils that worsened with every inhalation. It sang a song of inevitability and mortality. \nNex had seen when the Alpu, laying on its side, had bleated in agony after breaking its leg. It had probably stumbled whilst running away from a predator or slipped on one of the many large smooth stones in the area. No matter the cause, the result was the same. It was going to die a slow, painful death. He made his way cautiously to the large creature. The wild eyes and flaring nostrils of the animal were warning enough of the potential harm it may be able to cause to him if he didn’t proceed with care. As he approached, it caught his scent and attempted to stand but failed. It cried out desperately flailing its functional legs and bucking its head. Despite its cries, none of its herd came to help as was typical of Alpu. This fact caused Nex to frown because he realized it was just like him. He too had been left abandoned by those closest to him and broken. \nHe shook his head and stared at the Alpu. He brought his finger to the air and slowly drew a pale, crimson line over its head. In an instant, its legs stopped failing as its head crumpled to the earth. It was on his second trip he had this encounter, and Nex made sure to visit this sight on every trip afterward as a sign of respect.\n After trudging the path for hours, his hair was shaggy and peppered with leaves. His dark gray tunic was riddled with holes and mud-covered his calf-length leather boots. The once white undershirt now splotchy and brown. Lacerations shown on his fair skin, some from trips before this one. The steepness of the hill had made every fibre in his legs ache, and the sweat soaking into his wounds made them sizzle and burn. His young face sulky as his teeth grit with every movement. Under his breath, he ritualistically rehearsed what he would say once he arrived at the cabin, his voice trembling under the weight of his own words. The more he practiced, the more he thought of all the other times he had not managed the courage to say the words which made him want to practice more. It was a vicious cycle. \nThe path he walked was well-tread despite the overgrowth that surrounded it. While, admittedly, most of the footsteps had been his own, there were older tracks that told of the others that had made this journey. In his first trips, he had learned any attempt to cut the thick vines surrounding him was always met with the plants growing fiercely like cutting the head from a hydra. Using a long knife, he had to be careful not to cut or damage any of them as he had done on his first attempt, where he was almost consumed. Carefully, he used his knife as a needle and himself the thread carefully pulling himself through. \nThe sound of a rushing river roared ahead. Nex paused as he came to the familiar source. A steep ravine lay before him with white water rapids rushing over the smooth river rocks. He reached into the satchel and withdrew a small, flat multi-colored pebble with an insignia engraved on both of its sides. Slowly, he pressed the pebble onto his lips speaking a soft incantation then dropped the pebble into the ravine. It flickered and twirled in the light as it fell. \nEventually, it disappeared into the surging current. He grunted and opened a yellow hide journal. As he did, sigils began to glow brightly from the page, and colorful displays of words and figures sprang from the book, surrounding him. Wasting no time, his eyes danced across the page, checking the wind speeds, the depth of the ravine, and even the composition of the water. Then, he made a satisfied sigh and closed the book, which made the displays fade into oblivion. With both hands, he began drawing intricate runes in the air, each glowing its own vibrant color, each sparking with energy. Then with one swift motion, he encompassed the runes with a circle and commanded Astarzia. \n\""}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing style in this passage is descriptive and immersive, with a focus on sensory details and vivid imagery to create a clear and tangible setting.

{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Here Damian! This is another example of my technical writing, please analyze the style, science, and rhetoric that I used. Really get to know my writing style with this one:\n\n\"\nThe piezoelectric effect is the ability of materials to generate electricity in response to mechanical stress. Likewise, piezoelectric materials can receive electricity and convert it into mechanical stress. It has many applications, such as power sources, sensors, and motors. \n There have been many studies in vitro that show the potential that piezoelectric nFNIs could potentially be stable. Boron nitride nanotubes were used to stimulate PC-12, C2C12 cells, and SH-SY5Y cells to see if neurite growth would be expedited with electrical stimulation, which was found to be true[7.]. In another study, barium titanate was electrostatically attached to SH-SY5Y and induced calcium influxes when stimulated by ultrasound. Both of the nanoparticles were dispersed into the media, and they were rapidly internalized by the cells. As stated previously for quantum dots, the internalization of nFNIs is highly non-ideal due to the impossibility of retrieval. Likewise, the amount of energy produced by the vibrating nano piezo crystals is still unknown, meaning it may not be powerful enough to generate an action potential. \n Another relatively unknown aspect is the biocompatibility of the different piezocrystals. Boron nitride has been shown in vitro to not exhibit any toxicity in human kidney cells [29.], and barium titanate showed minimal toxicity in mouse osteoblasts 7F2 cells as it caused a nonsignificant inflammatory response[30.]. \nDesigning a theoretical system\n In this section of the paper, a theoretical brain-computer interface will be designed based on the current state of nFNIs. Ideally, the system would be capable of targeting a specific region of the brain in a safe, practical manner that would allow for high-resolution, bidirectional communication. The system would be designed for humans. Therefore, it would need to be made from materials approved for human use or have been proven to show no toxicity to human cells. Ideally, this system’s operation would not cause a significant temperature increase. The mean temperature of the brain is 38.4°C[31.], and at 40°C heatstrokes can occur[32.]. Therefore, the temperature should not be raised by 1°C to ensure patient safety. Lastly, the long-term viability of the neural interfaces used will be used to establish whether or not the system would be viable for long-term placement, and methods of complete retrieval will be investigated. \n The three types of signals viable for deep stimulation of human neurons are light, magnetic fields, and ultrasound. There seems to exist a tradeoff between spatial resolution and penetration depth. NIR light has a relatively low penetration depth of 4.4mm, but a spatial resolution of 0.05mm. Conversely, magnetic fields have a relatively good penetration depth of 5 cm. Still, they also have a low spatial resolution of 1 cm. Lastly, microwaves have a penetration depth of 5cm and a spatial resolution of 4mm. However, nFNIs being bound directly to target neurons will allow for precise stimulation regardless of spatial resolution. \n\nA fundamental problem with the three types of stimulation is that the signal depth is not deep enough to stimulate the brain’s deepest recesses from the surface. The average human brain has dimensions of 167mmx140mmx93mm[33.].\n \nEquation 1: Volume of an Ellipsoid where a equals the horizontal semi-axis(length), b equals the vertical semi-axis(height), and c equals the original axis (depth)\nUnder the assumption that the average brain’s area can be represented by an ellipsoid, the area affected by the primary signals can be calculated. Using the equation, the average volume of the human brain is approximately 1138 cm3. \nPrimary Energy Type\nThe volume of the brain affected in cm3\nPercentage of the Brain affected\nNIR\n223\n20.0%\nUltrasound\n641\n56.3%\nMagnetic\n901\n79.2%\nMicrowave\n901\n79.2%\n\nTable 4: Calculation of the Percentage of the brain affected by the different primary signals.\n\nIn the above table, the maximum penetration depth was utilized to approximate how much of the brain each primary signal could affect. Using equation 1, the penetration depth was subtracted from the radius of each dimension resulting in an ellipsoid of reduced size. The resulting ellipsoid represented the area unaffected by the signal, so each smaller ellipsoid was subtracted from the average volume of the human brain, 1138 cm3 to obtain the area affected by the signal. For the system to be a suitable advancement in the functional neural interfaces, nFNIs would need to be capable of modulation at any depth. Therefore, a system would need to account for the relatively low signal depth and unique properties of nFNIs. \nMany inventions are biomimetic in nature. To solve the dilemma of insufficient signal depth, I propose looking to neurons to provide an answer. Neurons can carry electrical signals across the body despite their relatively low power by using axons that are activated once the neuron is activated. Similarly, when stimulated, nFNIs could produce a secondary signal in their local area, potentially activating ion channels. However, instead of activating ion channels, the nFNIs could activate other nFNIs that can propagate the signal deeper into the brain. These long chains could essentially act as self-constructing nanowires that travel directly to the target neuron. These nanowires could work in networks or independently, but they could allow for deep ultrasonic, magnetic, or even optical stimulation. Likewise, recording nanowires could propagate signals received from neurons to relay activity to the surface of the brain, where they can be readily recorded. Ideally, the recording nanowires would be different nFNIs than the stimulating nFNIs to avoid noise or false positive signals. Likewise, the relay nFNIs would also be distinct from the stimulating nFNIs to avoid unintentional stimulation of nontargeted neurons while propagating the signal. \n\nFigure 4: The above figure depicts the proposed method for using scaffolding proteins to make nanowires. Each scaffolding protein would have three magnetic nanoparticles (one on the top, middle, and bottom). The magnetic nanoparticles would propagate the magnetic signal until it reached the magnetoelectric nanotransducer (figure on the left). The figure on the right depicts a similar system. However, the last scaffolding protein has a MMN attached to the end, which would be used to stimulate the piezoelectric crystal.\n Of the four nFNIs previously described, only three will be considered for the system. MMNs, MENS, and piezocrystals all exhibited minimal to no cytotoxicity, but QDs have shown to be highly toxic if the coating dissolves. While it may have interesting properties, it should not be used in humans for a practical system. Therefore with the restriction that the system would require different nFNIs for stimulation, relay, and recording, MMNs, MENs, and piezocrystals will be evaluated for their ability for each role. \nPiezocrystals and MENs would most likely serve as the best stimulating nFNI. Piezocrystals could be a good option due to the universality of electricity in modulating/activating neurons. MMNs would not be as good of a candidate because mechanosensitive ion channels are not as prevalent as voltage-gated ion channels. Electricity offers a reliable method of altering excitability throughout various neurons. For MENs to be a stimulating nFNI, a nanowire composed of magnetic nanoparticles would need to be used as the relay signal to propagate the signal to the neuron. For piezocrystals to be an ideal stimulating nFNI, MMNs could be used as the relay nFNI because they could mechanically stress the piezocrystal resulting in an electric charge. However, for the attached MMN to receive the signal, a nanowire made of nanomagnets would also need to be attached to the MMN. Experimentation would need to be conducted to determine which method would be superior as both show potential for the modulation of neurons.\nFor the recording nFNI, neuronal electrical activity will need to be detected and propagated to the brain’s surface for simplified measurement. Therefore, piezo crystals or MENs would be the best candidates. Ideally, the recording nanowires would differ in signal propagation methods than the stimulating nanowires, but it does not mean the system would be incapable of functioning as intended. The problem can be solved by ensuring the nanowire has some form of insulation to hinder the spread of the signal. The insulation can be in the form of a substrate or binding protein, as discussed later. MENs will most likely prove to be the most efficient recording nFNI. It can convert the received electrical input from the neuron directly into a magnetic field that can be propagated through the wire. Near the brain’s surface, the tail-end of the wire would be topped with a corresponding MEN to convert the signal to electricity for measurement. \nWhile most of the current studies involving nFNIs occurring in vitro show stable neural interfaces, the neural interfaces may not necessarily be stable in vivo. With this in mind, the nanowire would need to be anchored to the ion channels of the target neuron and the skull for efficient signal propagation. Having the nFNIs bound to a protein would reduce the likelihood of internalization of the individual particle. Likewise, if the particles are in the form of nanowires, it would significantly reduce the chance of internalization. Ideally, the protein would be a durable, biocompatible material capable of binding to the respective nFNI, isolating the signal produced by the nFNI, and binding to other proteins to form the nanowires. Due to the specificity of the requirements needed for such a protein, there has not been any evidence in the literature of such a protein. Scaffolding proteins show an interesting starting point for investigation. Scaffolding proteins typically help to relay messages between the cell membrane and the nucleus[34.]. If a scaffolding protein could be designed to hold the magnetic nanoparticles as shown in figure 4, it would allow for testing of the proposed nano interface. \nFuture Perspectives\n Nano functional neural interfaces is a rapidly developing field with many vital insights being found daily. In this paper, QDs, MENs, MMNs, and piezocrystals were investigated for their biocompatibility, feasibility, and potential for use in a theoretical brain-computer interface. nFNIs show great potential in overcoming the insensibility and indistinguishability problems currently held by the field as a whole. However, nFNIs are still limited by the penetration depth and spatial resolution of the stimulating signals. For the field to progress, noninvasive stimulation methods would need to advance, allowing for higher spatial resolution and greater depth. In this paper, a potential solution was proposed to the problem in the form of protein chains containing nFNIs to relay the signal bidirectionally. The proposed solution would require the discovery of a protein capable of handling the design requirements needed to bind to the nFNIs, insulate the signal, and form durable chains that will need to be investigated further. If these advancements are made, the proposed solution could potentially help to push the understanding of the brain to new levels.\n\""}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The technical writing excerpt discusses the piezoelectric effect and its potential applications in designing a theoretical brain-computer interface.

This can then help you to give praise and feedback effectively, assign them suitable tasks, and keep them motivated.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore McClelland's Human Motivation Theory, and look at how you can use it to manage and lead your team more effectively.\n\nNote:\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory is also known as Three Needs Theory, Acquired Needs Theory, Motivational Needs Theory, and Learned Needs Theory.\n\nUnderstanding McClelland's Theory\nIn the early 1940s, Abraham Maslow created his theory of needs. This identified the basic needs that human beings have, in order of their importance: physiological needs, safety needs, and the needs for belonging, self-esteem and \"self-actualization\".\n\nLater, David McClelland built on this work in his 1961 book, \"The Achieving Society.\" He identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. [1]\n\nAccording to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).\n\nMcClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are as follows:\n\nDominant Motivator\n\nCharacteristics of This Person\n\nAchievement\n\nHas a strong need to set and accomplish challenging goals.\nTakes calculated risks to accomplish their goals.\nLikes to receive regular feedback on their progress and achievements.\nOften likes to work alone.\nAffiliation\n\nWants to belong to the group.\nWants to be liked, and will often go along with whatever the rest of the group wants to do.\nFavors collaboration over competition.\nDoesn't like high risk or uncertainty.\nPower\n\nWants to control and influence others.\nLikes to win arguments.\nEnjoys competition and winning.\nEnjoys status and recognition.\nNote:\nThose with a strong power motivator are often divided into two groups: personal and institutional. People with a personal power drive want to control others, while people with an institutional power drive like to organize the efforts of a team to further the company's goals. As you can probably imagine, those with an institutional power need are usually more desirable as team members!\n\nUsing the Theory\nMcClelland's theory can help you to identify the dominant motivators of people on your team. You can then use this information to influence how you set goals and provide feedback, and how you motivate and reward team members.\n\nYou can also use these motivators to craft, or design, the job around your team members, ensuring a better fit.\n\nLet's look at the steps for using McClelland's theory:\n\nStep 1: Identify Drivers\nExamine your team to determine which of the three motivators is dominant for each person. You can probably identify drivers based on personality and past actions.\n\nFor instance, perhaps one of your team members always takes charge of the group when you assign a project. They speak up in meetings to persuade people, and delegate responsibilities to others to meet the goals of the group. They like to be in control of the final deliverables. This team member is likely primarily driven by power.\n\nYou might have another team member who never speaks during meetings. They always agree with the group, work hard to manage conflict when it occurs, and visibly become uncomfortable when you talk about doing high-risk, high-reward projects. This person is likely to have a strong need for affiliation.\n\nStep 2: Structure Your Approach\nBased on the driving motivators of your workers, structure your leadership style and project assignments around each individual team member. This will help ensure that they all stay engaged, motivated, and happy with the work they're doing.\n\nExamples of Using the Theory\nLet's take a closer look at how to manage team members who are driven by each of McClelland's three motivators:\n\nAchievement\nPeople motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.\n\nWhen providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.\n\nAffiliation\nPeople motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.\n\nWhen providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.\n\nPower\nThose with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.\n\nWhen providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals.\n\nComparative Theories\nMcClelland's theory of needs is not the only theory about worker motivation. Sirota's Three-Factor Theory also presents three motivating factors that workers need to stay motivated and excited about what they're doing: equity/fairness, achievement, and camaraderie.\n\nSirota's theory states that we all start a new job with lots of enthusiasm and motivation to do well. But over time, due to bad company policies and poor work conditions, many of us lose our motivation and excitement.\n\nThis is different from McClelland's theory, which states that we all have one dominant motivator that moves us forward, and this motivator is based on our culture and life experiences.\n\nUse your best judgment when motivating and engaging your team. Understanding a variety of motivational theories will help you decide which approach is best in any given situation.\n\nNote:\nYou may also see these abbreviations for McClelland's three motivators: Achievement (nAch), Affiliation (nAff), and Power (nPow).\n\nKey Points\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory states that every person has one of three main driving motivators: the needs for achievement, affiliation, or power. These motivators are not inherent; we develop them through our culture and life experiences.\n\nAchievers like to solve problems and achieve goals. Those with a strong need for affiliation don't like to stand out or take risk, and they value relationships above anything else. Those with a strong power motivator like to control others and be in charge.\n\nYou can use this information to lead, praise, and motivate your team more effectively, and to better structure your team's roles.\""}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the answer to the question is readily answerable from the provided content.

few lessons we talked about setting up a niche we talked about finding a problem to solve we talked about pricing we talked about location dependence and now this is the final step in what you need to do to create your location independent high income low work alpha two penal business and what's interesting is that most guys or women when they start a business they focus on this step first and this is actually the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of

{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Title: \"(1) Business Builder Challenge Day 6 - How To Make Sure Your Business is LOCATION INDEPENDENT - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"all right in the last few lessons we talked about setting up a niche we talked about finding a problem to solve we talked about pricing we talked about location dependence and now this is the final step in what you need to do to create your location independent high income low work alpha two penal business and what's interesting is that most guys or women when they start a business they focus on this step first and this is actually the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of

Existing CNNs applied to NLP tasks use one-dimensional\n(temporal) convolution to the concatenate of vector encoding of each word in a text. Unlike prior\nworks, we apply multi-dimension (spatial) convolution of CNN to multiple representations of the\ninput text, in which the convolution kernel acts as attention.\nIn this section, we first introduce the model architecture and then describe the embedding\nstrategies used in the model.\n\nthis is section 2 of it do you understand this?"}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I understand the contents of this section.
