No worries! Message reprocessing lets you send it again and iron out those hiccups. \n\n2. **Data Synchronization:** Got some data updates in the source system after a message has been processed? Reprocessing helps sync those updates seamlessly with your target system. \n\n3. **Data Quality Improvement:** Spotting some data quirks that slipped through the first time? Reprocess those messages to catch and fix any missed issues. 🔍\n\n4. **Increased Efficiency:** Opting for reprocessing can be a smarter move than extracting and reloading tons of data, especially when you're handling large datasets! 🚀\n\nIn essence, message reprocessing boosts the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of your data integration tasks with SKYVVA in Salesforce! 🎉✨"}], "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "In a Salesforce data integration with SKYVVA, message reprocessing can be useful in a number of ways:\n\n1. Error recovery: If an error occurs during the initial processing of a message, message reprocessing allows you to resend the message and try to process it again, potentially resolving the error.\n2. Data synchronization: If data in the source system is updated after a message is initially processed, message reprocessing can be used to synchronize the updated data with the target system.\n3. Data quality improvement: By reprocessing messages, you can catch and correct any data issues that may have been missed during the initial processing.\n4. Increased efficiency: Reprocessing messages can be more efficient than re-extracting and re-loading the data from the source system, especially for large amounts of data.\n\nOverall, message reprocessing can help improve the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of your data integration with SKYVVA in Salesforce."}]}

The `parent_id` column stores the ID of the parent node, allowing you to reconstruct the tree structure.
