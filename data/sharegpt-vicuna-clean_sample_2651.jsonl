{"prompt": "", "input": "Sure, I'd be happy to review the Samsung S22 Ultra. \n\nThe Samsung S22 Ultra is a high-end flagship smartphone from Samsung. It features a 6.9-inch Infinity O display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The camera setup consists of four cameras on the rear, providing users with a 108-megapixel main sensor, 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, 10-megapixel telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel depth sensor. In addition, the front-facing camera is a 40-megapixel unit.\n\nThe Samsung S22 Ultra is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, combined with an Adreno 660 GPU and 12GB of RAM. It also features a 5,000 mAh battery that supports fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging.\n\nIn comparison to other flagships, the Samsung S22 Ultra has a few advantages. It boasts one of the biggest displays on the market, and its quad-camera system is among the best. Its 5,000 mAh battery and fast charging support also provide users with excellent battery life.\n\nHowever, the price of the Samsung S22 Ultra is quite high, and it may not be the right choice for some users. Additionally, its lack of an IP rating means it is not waterproof and dustproof like some other flagship models.\n\nOverall, the Samsung S22 Ultra is a great device for those looking for a top-of-the-line smartphone. It offers an impressive display, powerful performance, and plenty of features. However, the high price tag may be a turn-off for some.", "answer": "Iphone 14 pro max"}

{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 5 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 1 - Contractual obligations regarding waterproofing\n\nThe appellant’s case was that, by reason of the specific contractual terms: “waterproofing membrane to sill to be provided by builder”; and that the appellant was “responsible for waterproofing of our windows only. If structure is not waterproofed correctly, warranties are voided”, the appellant was not responsible for the installation of flashing around the windows.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the terms of the contract were superseded by the Deed. The respondents relied upon clause 14 of the Deed which provided:\n\n14. Entire agreement\n\nThis Deed\n\n14.1 constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its subject matter; and\n\n14.2 in relation to that subject matter, supersedes any prior understanding or agreement between the parties and any prior condition, warranty, indemnity or representation imposed, given or made by a party.\n\nIn reply, the appellant referred to clause 7 of the Deed which we have set out at [6] above. The appellant submitted that clause 7 preserved the terms of the original contract, and that clause 14, properly construed, was intended “to avoid arguments that pre-Deed negotiations, oral representations and correspondence could form part of the Deed or affect its construction”.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed the appellant’s submissions regarding the contractual obligations relating to waterproofing at [57] as follows:\n\nThe respondents raise, by way of defence, that the windows failed because the builder, Mr Bannister, failed to install the window flashings in accordance with good building practice and that the builder’s failure to install flashing is causative of the leaks in all three windows and therefore causative of the applicant’s loss. I accept and prefer the expert evidence of Mr Brennan in his report of 17 May 2020 that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” and accept that the report of Mr Sim in respect of the flashing should be disregarded because the Schlegel Test Mr Sim considered is “irrelevant to the windows fitted on site into a timber frame with light weight external cladding”. On balance where Mr Brennan and Mr Sim differ on the issue of flashing, I accept and prefer the opinion of Mr Brennan as the more experienced expert in respect of window manufacture and installation. I also find that as Mr Sim adopted the wrong Schlegel Test, his opinion is not as persuasive.\n\nReference to the respective experts’ reports is necessary to understand that conclusion.\n\nMr Brennan’s opinion was that the windows leaked both by reason of the absence of small joint sealer and by reason of the absence of flashing around the windows.\n\nMr Sim’s opinion was that there was small joint sealer and that flashing of the windows was unnecessary. In support of the proposition that flashing was unnecessary Mr Sim stated that “the windows [are] manufactured from commercial grade sections and used sub-heads and sub-sills which act [as] a flashing”.\n\nMr Sim also stated “there is no requirement for additional flashing to the head, jambs or sills of this type of window, if installed in the correct manner as per the Schlegel Test Report.”\n\nThe Schlegel Test Report was a test report issued by Schlegel Pty Ltd, an NATA accredited laboratory, which certified the performance of a sample window. The test was carried out in 2010.\n\nMr Brennan’s evidence in reply was that testing in a “Schlegel portable test rig” did not extend to flashing as:\n\n…there are many varied building structures by which windows and doors need to be assembled into, so it is impossible to test in all building envelope constructions…\n\nThe Tribunal’s conclusion that Mr Brennan’s evidence should be preferred to the evidence of Mr Sim was a finding of fact. Clearly the Tribunal determined that the windows required flashing and that flashing had not been installed.\n\nThe conclusion that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” was based upon the statement in paragraph 4.5 of Mr Brennan’s reply report that:\n\n…Sub heads, sub jambs, and sub/sump sills are a means of installation usually used in commercial shop front and residential concrete construction. They do not substitute for flashing at any time, but especially when a cavity wall construction or timber frame light weight cladding is used. If you are using all these elements to install, you still need to flash to the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame, through to internal wall surfaces.\n\nMr Brennan did not state that it was the responsibility of the window supplier and installer to “flash to the building element”, only that it was necessary to install flashing. However, Mr Brennan did state in his oral evidence that the flashing of a window was part of the installation of the window rather than preparation of the opening for the installation of the window.\n\nIn rejecting the appellant’s submission that any leakage arising from the absence of flashing was the responsibility of the builder and not the appellant, the Tribunal does not appear to have considered the question whether the contractual provisions relating to responsibility for waterproofing cast the responsibility to install flashing on the builder, or if so, whether those provisions were superseded by the Deed.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal determined that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant and concluded on that basis that the windows were defective and required replacement.\n\nAccordingly, the question who was responsible for the installation of flashing was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was responsible for the cost of replacement of the windows. The fact that the absence of flashing might have contributed to the extent of leakage could not alter the conclusion that the windows were defective.\n\nAccordingly, ground 1 must be rejected. It involves neither an error of law nor a conclusion that was not fair and equitable or against the weight of evidence.\n\nWe reach this conclusion independently of the question whether clause 14 of the Deed, properly construed, excluded reference to the terms of the original contract. However, it is clear in our view that, in light of the explicit provision in clause 7 of the Deed, clause 14 cannot be construed as excluding reference to the terms of the original contract in ascertaining the extent of the appellant’s obligations.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 8 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 6 – failure to install small joint sealer\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in making a finding that the windows installed by the appellant were defective by reason of the appellant’s failure to utilise small joint sealer in the remanufacture of the windows, the Tribunal had relied upon evidence from Mr Brennan’s first report that he could not detect any gaskets or small joint sealer.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Tribunal had failed to take into account concessions later made by Mr Brennan in his report in reply and in his oral evidence, that he had been wrong in his first report.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sim had identified small joint sealant in the junction of the joinery pieces in the windows which had been removed and left disassembled on site. The appellant submitted that in his report in reply, Mr Brennan, at 4.4, had conceded there was evidence of sealant “in some joints” but that “some joints were not sealed well enough”.\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in cross-examination, Mr Brennan had agreed that he had assumed in his first report that no small joint sealant had been used and that there was evidence of small joint sealant in some photos included in Mr Sim’s report. The appellant further submitted that Mr Brennan had “conceded that he did not know whether or not the small joint sealant had been applied correctly by BW in the process of manufacture”.\n\nThe respondents submitted that Mr Brennan had not conceded that the small joint sealant had been applied appropriately. The respondents referred to evidence given by Mr Brennan during the hearing that:\n\nAt some point there may have been small joint sealant in there and that was obvious later on when I had seen the other experts’ reports. However, it doesn’t mean it was applied correctly and evenly to every joint.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the appellant’s submissions overlooked the proposition that the windows leaked through the window frames. The respondents submitted that “the absence or presence of gaskets or small joint sealer contributed to the leaks in the windows but were not the substantial cause of the problem”.\n\nIn reply, the appellant noted that the respondents had conceded that the absence or presence of small joint sealer was not the substantial cause of the problem and submitted that “the absence of flashing was the substantial cause of the problem”. The appellant submitted that Mr Brennan had conceded in cross-examination that he did not know whether or not there were any shortcomings in the use of small joint sealant in the manufacturing process.\n\nConsideration – Ground 6\n\nIt is clear in our view that the appellant’s challenge to the Tribunal’s finding that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant does not raise any question of law. The appellant’s challenge is rather on the basis that the finding was against the weight of evidence or was not fair and equitable.\n\nThe finding of the Tribunal that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant was a finding of fact supported by the evidence of Mr Brennan. Contrary to appellant’s submissions, Mr Brennan did not at any time concede that the small joint sealant had been correctly applied within the windows. His only concession was that there was apparently some sealant within the windows but he could not say whether it had been correctly applied.\n\nWe are not persuaded that the finding of the Tribunal was against the weight of evidence or not fair and equitable. There was evidence that the windows were leaking and Mr Brennan gave evidence in his initial report that one reason for the leaking windows was the absence of gaskets or small joint sealant. Although he acknowledged in his reply report and in oral evidence that there was some sealant apparent within the windows, he did not resile from his evidence that one reason for the windows leaking was the absence of small joint sealant.\n\nMoreover, in circumstances where Mr Brennan’s evidence had clearly raised the issue whether gaskets or small joint sealant had been applied in the manufacture of the windows, the Tribunal was entitled to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference from the unexplained absence of evidence from any person who had been involved in the manufacture of the windows, that the evidence of any such person would not be of assistance to the appellant. By reason of that inference, the Tribunal could more readily accept the evidence of Mr Brennan that small joint sealant had not been properly installed.\n\nAccordingly, ground 6 must be rejected and leave to appeal on that ground must be refused.\n\nGround 7 – the cost of scaffolding\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in awarding $9,240 in respect of scaffolding, the Tribunal had failed to recognise that the respondents’ claim in respect of scaffolding had been reduced to $3,960 at the outset of the hearing.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sibilia in his evidence had initially relied upon a different document, which was an invoice dated 20 September 2019 in the amount of $9,240 for “scaffolding services rendered at the above site address”. The applicant submitted that that invoice clearly included charges for the hire of scaffolding for a period prior to the execution of the Deed.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Deed released the appellant from liability in respect of the hire of scaffolding up to the date of the Deed.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the invoice for scaffolding in the sum of $9,240 was the cost incurred by the respondents in relation to the provision of scaffolding in the period after the execution of the Deed. The respondents also submitted:\n\n“In an effort to try and resolve the matter prior to the initial hearing, the respondents requested from the scaffolding company a quote for the two weeks that the scaffolding was in place to enable the appellant’s replacement defective windows to be removed and new Wideline windows installed with make good, noting that the removal of scaffolding and reinstallation of the Wideline windows would have been a far more expensive exercise than having the scaffolding there the whole time. This was confirmed by Mr Sibilia in evidence in his cross examination [T1556-1558]. This quote came in at $3,960 (inc GST).”\n\nThe respondents submitted that the Tribunal had awarded the sum of $9,240 “as per the invoice for scaffolding as the appellant had provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary”.\n\nIn the lines of the transcript of Mr Sibilia’s evidence referred to by the respondents, Mr Sibilia stated in relation to the original claim of $9,240:\n\n“That’s what I paid because the scaffolding was there for the period of time that – we’ve adjusted that to be – for the minimum period to cover the time between completion of windows by the [inaudible] and that’s been sent through. So we’ve adjusted that down.”\n\nIn its reply submissions the appellant explained the issue more clearly as follows:\n\nThe respondents initially claimed $9,240 on the basis of invoice No 1742 dated 20 September 2019.\n\nShortly before the hearing, BW served its Tender Bundle which included another invoice No 1742 from the same scaffolding firm, this time dated 17 December 2018 in the sum of $4,420. BW could not have been liable for this amount, as it was before the Deed of Release. Further, the existence of two invoices with the same number made the later invoice unreliable as evidence.\n\nFaced with this, the respondents reduced their claim for scaffolding to $3,960 incl GST at the outset of the hearing. This was on the basis of a different document, a “Quotation” (rather than an invoice) dated 3 March 2020.\n\nAfter the hearing, the respondents in their final written submissions maintained the reduced claim for $3,960.\n\nIn relation to the quote for $3,960 the appellant submitted:\n\n“There is no evidence to support the scaffolding hire claim for $3,960, as the quote dated 3 March 2020 produced by the respondents in support of this claim was not explained in evidence. The document certainly does not speak for itself in terms of damages caused by breach of contract.\n\nConsideration – Ground 7\n\nThe Tribunal’s reasoning in relation to the award of the cost of the scaffolding was as follows, at [59]:\n\n“I accept the uncontested evidence of Mr Sibilia … that due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished. I award $9,240 for the scaffolding cost as per the invoice at Y4. I note that the respondent has provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary.”\n\nAlthough Mr Sibilia had stated in his affidavit that “due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished”, no explanation was provided why it was necessary to have scaffolding in place for seven and a half months when the windows installed by the appellant were removed and the replacement Wideline windows were installed in June. In his cross-examination Mr Sibilia acknowledged (in the passage set out above) that the amount of $9,240 which the respondents had paid was for a longer period than was necessary for the removal of the defective windows and installation of the Wideline windows. The respondents had limited their claim at the hearing to the $3,960 set out in the quote and it is apparent from the transcript that he was cross-examined on the basis that the respondents’ claim had been so limited.\n\nShortly after the answer set out above Mr Sibilia gave the following evidence:\n\n“We said that we would look at these from the point of view that look at your claims and work out – I mean we also have rent [inaudible] but we struck that out and we’ve also looked at scaffolding and reduced it to a period of time that covers when the replacement windows were put in.”\n\nThe cross-examination then moved to other topics.\n\nThe respondents sought to suggest that it would have been much more expensive to erect fresh scaffolding and take it down again. However, the quote obtained by the respondents dated 3 March 2020 - which was provided by the scaffolding contractor who had rendered the invoice dated 20 September 2019, and must therefore be taken to have been familiar with the requirements for the installation of the scaffolding – indicates that the cost would have been substantially less.\n\nThe narration to the quote is:\n\n“To supply, deliver, erect, dismantle and remove aluminium scaffolding 450kg (SWL) from the above site address\n\nTo scaffold rear of house adjacent to windows”\n\nIn our view there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support the conclusion that the invoice for $9,240 was in its entirety a cost incurred in relation to the replacement of the windows. Mr Sibilia’s statement in his affidavit did not go that far and his evidence in cross-examination was to the contrary. Moreover, the quotation of March 2020 clearly indicates that the amount of $9,240 was well in excess of the cost of providing scaffolding for the purpose of replacing the windows.\n\nAs we have noted above, the onus lay upon the respondents to prove their damages including providing evidence to establish the cost of the scaffolding necessary for the replacement of the windows.\n\nIn our view the award of $9,240 was either made without evidence or was against the weight of evidence and not fair and equitable. To award the respondents an amount they had explicitly not sought at the hearing would involve a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant in circumstances where it is apparent that the cross-examination of Mr Sibilia was predicated on the fact that the respondents only sought the amount of the quote and not the whole amount paid. It follows that the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding must be set aside. To the extent necessary we would grant leave to appeal against the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding.\n\nNevertheless, we do not consider that the respondents should receive nothing for the cost of scaffolding. Mr Dalgleish suggested at the hearing of the appeal that an allowance of $1,000 would be appropriate. However, we consider that there is evidence of the cost of providing scaffolding for the removal and replacement of the windows. We do not accept the appellant’s submission that the quotation of 3 March 2020 is not evidence of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows. That document was provided by the contractor who had provided scaffolding for the construction project and correctly identified the relevant site and the location of the windows which required replacement.\n\nWhether or not the document would meet the requirements for admissibility under the Evidence Act, the laws of evidence do not apply in the Tribunal. We consider that the quotation is sufficient evidence to establish that the appropriate compensation in respect of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows was $3,960 inclusive of GST.\n\nWe note in this context that the quote included the cost of erection and dismantling of the scaffolding, which were costs in respect of which the builder had invoiced the respondents in the third of the builder’s invoices. As we have not allowed the respondents any compensation in respect of the builder’s invoices, there is no risk of double counting in awarding the respondents the full value of the quotation.\n\nAccordingly, we will reduce the judgment sum by a further $5,280 (the difference between $9,240 and $3,960).\n\nWe note that the amount awarded by the Tribunal, $50,771.69, is $2,090 less than the sum of the three amounts which the respondents claimed. This discrepancy was not explained in the decision. It is not necessary to explore that matter further. The amount to which we consider the respondents were entitled was $14,020 in respect of the supply of the windows and $3,960 for scaffolding. The sum of those figures is $17,980, which is the amount to which we will vary the amount of the judgment.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

The appellant appealed against that order.\n\nIn its reply submissions the appellant submitted that:\n\n“No order for costs should be made either in respect of the appeal or the proceedings at first instance until both sides have had the opportunity to make further written submissions in light of the outcome of the appeal.\n\nAs we have reduced the amount awarded by the Tribunal by approximately two thirds, it is possible that there may have been offers made between the parties which might be relevant to the question of costs. The order made by the Tribunal in relation to the costs of the application should be set aside.\n\nIt is appropriate that the parties have the opportunity to file submissions concerning the question of costs both at first instance and in respect of the appeal.\n\nAt the hearing both parties agreed that the question of costs could be determined on the papers without a further hearing and accordingly we will allow the parties to file submissions concerning the question of costs both at first instance and on appeal. We will then determine costs of both the first instance hearing and the appeal on the basis of the submissions provided.\n\nOur orders are:\n\nAppeal allowed in part.\n\nGrant leave to appeal to the extent necessary in relation to the award of $9,240 in respect of the costs of scaffolding.\n\nVary Order (1) made on 2 October 2020 by changing the sum of $50,771.69 to the sum of $17,980.\n\nSet aside Order (2) made on 2 October 2020.\n\nThe stay of the orders made by the Tribunal on 2 October 2020, granted by the Appeal Panel on 4 November 2020, is lifted.\n\nAny application by either party for an order in relation to the costs either of the proceedings at first instance or of the appeal, with evidence and submissions in support of the application, is to be filed and served within 14 days of the date of these orders.\n\nAny evidence and submissions in response to any application filed in accordance with Order (6) are to be filed and served within a further 14 days.", "answer": "Acknowledged, please continue."}

the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of mechanisms now where you can deliver hard services soft services information all kinds of things where you don't physically have to be there and then obviously you can get the money from the kleiner customer even if it's a lot of money without physically having to be there i do wire transfers all the time for big big big payments because i run three companies matter of fact just last week i did a wire transfer for what it was 20 000 to a company i do business with internationally and i didn't have to physically be there i'm set up on my online banking to do my own wire transfer so i don't to call a bank every time like most people do because again i'm location independent so this is your delivery system location independent that's the name of the game and if it's not location dependent if the client says i have to give you a check there are still people out there like this matter of fact my wife was just working with a person a little while ago and he was like no i only pay via check if they insist on paying checks you don't do business if it's an old school industry that insists on physically handing you a piece of paper for something you don't do business or you don't do that kind of business everything must be location dependent both the delivery system to the client and the payment system from the client or customer cool now again what most people do when they start a business is this is the first

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n35 In the result, the Master dismissed the Council’s cross-claim, save that he held that “the Council is entitled to damages for two small matters”.\nThe judgment of 7 December 2004\n36 The matter was then re-listed for further argument. At that stage, the Council orally sought leave to amend its pleadings to incorporate a claim for liquidated damages. In opposing this application, Beckhaus, submitted (as the Master observed):\n\n“The [Contract] was discharged by implied agreement through the parties’ mutual abandonment of the [Contract] in or about early 2002.”\n37 On 7 December 2004 Master Macready handed down a further judgment.\n38 He noted that the parties had agreed that the amount owing in respect of his findings on the cross-claim was $40,000.\n39 In dealing with the application by the Council to amend so as to claim liquidated damages, the Master rejected Beckhaus’ argument that the Contract had been abandoned or terminated. In doing so, he appears to have assumed that Beckhaus’ contentions were based on the proposition that, by mutual agreement, the Contract had been rescinded ab initio. (Mr Rudge SC who, together with Mr Robertson, appeared for Beckhaus, disavowed to this Court having submitted at trial that the Contract had been so rescinded). The Master held that neither party had evinced such an intention.\n40 It appears that the Council accepted before the Master that, by reason of extensions of time to which Beckhaus was probably entitled, the date for practical completion (in respect of both Separable Portions A and B of the Contract) should be taken to be 31 March 2002. That being so, under the Contract the claim for liquidated damages could run from no earlier date.\n41 Master Macready upheld Beckhaus’ submission that the Council was precluded from claiming liquidated damages after 27 May 2002. His reasoning was as follows. He held that the Council had failed to pay progress claim No 7 unconditionally. On the basis of that finding, Beckhaus, in terms of s 27(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act, had lawfully suspended work on 27 May 2002. It followed, the Master held, that the superintendent, acting reasonably, would have extended time for practical completion until unconditional payment was made. Accordingly, work (and practical completion) remained lawfully suspended as at the judgment date. Under the Contract, there could be no claim for liquidated damages for the period during which the time for practical completion was so suspended (that is, during the period from 27 May 2002 to the date of judgment).\n42 The Master noted that there had been “no identification of any determination” of the Contract (the Council was then contending that the Contract had not been terminated). He said:\n\n“The parties have not identified any matter in the present evidence that would be an end date [for the period of liquidated damages] and the likelihood is that any entitlement to liquidated damages will only arise following upon some other facts which lead to a termination of the contract after the present time.”\n43 For this reason, and the relatively small amount that, on the Master’s reasons, the Council could claim (that is, based only on a “likely” period of about two months – from not earlier than 31 March 2002 to 27 May 2002) the Master declined to give leave to plead a claim for liquidated damages.\n44 The Master turned to Variation 21. The gist of this claim was that, in breach of the Contract, the superintendent had failed to provide Beckhaus with a list of defects upon Beckhaus asserting that practical completion had been reached. Beckhaus contended that this failure caused it to keep its major earthmoving equipment at Brewarrina and entitled it to delay costs, alternatively to damages.\n45 Master Macready appears, however, to have upheld this claim on a different basis, namely, because the Council had substantially failed in its cross-claim, there was no practical need for Beckhaus to have kept its equipment on site as the superintendent had required. The Master said:\n\n“It is apparent from discussions, which took place on 3 April 2002 between the Council and [Beckhaus], that the Council was raising a large number of matters which might require further work by [Beckhaus]. The matter escalated into the service of notices of dispute on about 24 April 2002 and accordingly it was probably reasonable for [Beckhaus] to keep its equipment on site until the time claimed namely 27 April 2002. In my view [Beckhaus] is entitled to this variation.”", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 8 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe orders made by the Master\n46 Relevantly, Master Macready made orders:\n(1) Granting a verdict and judgment in favour of Beckhaus in the sum of $809,236.54.\n\n(2) Granting a verdict and judgment in favour of the Council on its cross-claim in the sum of $40,000.\n\n(3) Otherwise dismissing the cross-claim.\n\n(4) Ordering the Council to pay Beckhaus interest in the sum of $135,772.99.\n\n(5) “In consolidation” of the orders referred to in (1), (2) and (3) above, granting a verdict and judgment in favour of Beckhaus in the sum of $905,009.53.\n\n(6) Ordering the Council to pay Beckhaus’ costs on various basis.\n\n(7) Ordering the Council to pay Mr Beckhaus’ costs of the cross-claim.\n47 The sum of $905,009.53 (the “consolidated” verdict) appears to have been arrived at as follows. By adding interest in the sum of $135,772.99 (as ordered by the Master – see (4) above) to the verdict of $809,236.54 (see (1) above), the sum of $945,009.53 is arrived at. $945,009.53 less the amount of $40,000 awarded to the Council (see (2) above) is $905,009.53.\n48 I assume that the judgment sum of $809,236.54 is the aggregate of progress claim No 7 and Variation 17. There is, however, no specific mention of Variation 21 in the orders that were made. According to the Council’s notice of appeal the amount awarded in respect of Variation 21 was $101,560. I can only assume that this sum formed part of the award of interest. The parties did not explain these matters to the Court.\nThe notice of appeal and the notice of contention\n49 By its notice of appeal the Council, in summary, contended that Master Macready erred in the following respects:\n(a) In holding that the Council was not entitled to damages for Beckhaus’ breach of the Contract in failing to provide test results indicating that compaction around the culverts complied with the specification.\n\n(b) In holding that the Council was not entitled to damages for Beckhaus’ breach of the Contract in failing to add 3% lime to the material to be compacted.\n\n(c) In holding that the Council was not entitled to damages for Beckhaus’ breach of the Contract in failing to achieve linear shrinkage not exceeding 12%.\n\n(d) In holding that the levees were compacted in accordance with the specification.\n\n(e) In holding that the Contract was a divisible contract, that there had been substantial performance by Beckhaus and that the Council’s claim for total failure of consideration was unsuccessful.\n\n(f) In holding that the condition precedent to the issuing of a payment certificate by the superintendent (in respect of progress claim No 7) had been satisfied.\n\n(g) In holding that, in accordance with the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act , Beckhaus was entitled to payment of progress claim No 7.\n\n(h) In holding that Beckhaus was entitled to payment of Variation 17.\n\n(i) In holding that Beckhaus was entitled to payment of Variation 21.\n\n(j) In ordering that the Council pay the costs of Beckhaus and Mr Beckhaus.\n\n(k) In refusing the Council’s application to amend so as to claim liquidated damages.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n50 In its notice of contention Beckhaus alleged that Master Macready had erred in failing to find that the Contract “had been abandoned in futuro or terminated by the implied agreement or mutual acquiescence of the parties, and that therefore [the Council’s] claim for liquidated damages could not succeed, even if [the Council] were given leave to amend”.\n51 The notice of contention also asserted that the Council’s application for leave to amend so as to claim liquidated damages should, in any event, have been refused “by reason of the numerous areas of factual inquiry requiring further evidence which would have been raised by the proposed amended cross-claim”.\n52 The notice of appeal and the notice of contention raised many other grounds that are encompassed in the grounds I have summarised above or which were not agitated on appeal or which have become irrelevant. I would add that there was a notice of cross-appeal filed by Beckhaus which, in effect, has been subsumed by the issues raised in the notice of appeal and the notice of contention.\nClaiming damages for defective performance while the Contract was on foot\n53 The notice of contention raises the question whether the Contract was terminated by mutual agreement. The Council long denied this proposition but, on the third day of the appeal, assented to it. Despite the Council’s late acceptance of the proposition, the question remains relevant as it exposes a misconception by both parties in the way the issues were addressed at trial. The misconception was that the Council could claim damages from Beckhaus for defective and incomplete work while the work was still in Beckhaus’ possession and while Beckhaus was still obliged (and entitled) to execute the work to practical completion. This misconception permeated the conduct of the case by all involved and complicated the identification of the true issues in the case.\n54 The reason for the Council’s stand is not hard to find. It lies in cl 35.6 of the General Conditions which provided:\n\n‘If [Beckhaus] fails to reach Practical Completion by the date for Practical Completion, [Beckhaus] shall be indebted to [the Council] for liquidated damages at the rate stated in the Annexure for every day after the Date for Practical Completion to and including the Date of Practical Completion or the date that the Contract is terminated under Clause 44, whichever first occurs.”\n\nThe Council wished to assert that the Contract remained on foot so as to enable it to make a large claim for liquidated damages. Thus, the Council believed that it was in its interests to contend that the Contract had not been terminated but, at the same time, to claim damages for defective and incomplete work.\n55 It is helpful to identify Beckhaus’ obligations to perform the work under the Contract, Beckhaus’ rights to be paid for its work, and the Council’s rights in respect of breaches of the Contract by Beckhaus. Once those obligations and rights are identified, consideration must be given as to whether there was an agreed termination and, if so, how they were affected by the agreed termination.\n56 By cl 3.1 of the General Conditions, Beckhaus undertook to execute and complete the work under the Contract and the Council undertook to pay Beckhaus:\n\n“(a) for work for which the [Council] accepted a lump sum, the lump sum;\n(b) for work for which the [Council] accepted rates, the sum ascertained by multiplying the measured quantity of each section or item of work actually carried out under the contract by the rate accepted by the [council] for the section or item,\nadjusted by any additions or deductions made pursuant to the contract.”\n\nThus, by cl 3.1, the Council’s obligation was to pay Beckhaus for the work executed and completed.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

Thus, by cl 30.3, the Council was entitled to require Beckhaus to remedy defective work before the Council was obliged to pay for it.\n58 Clause 35.2 provided that Beckhaus should execute the work under the Contract to the stage of practical completion by the date for practical completion. Beckhaus was obliged, on the date of practical completion, to give possession of the site and the work to the Council and, on that date, the Council was obliged to accept possession.\n59 At least while the Contract endured, until practical completion was achieved Beckhaus had no obligation and no right to deliver the work to the Council and the Council had no right to take possession of the work.\n60 The Contract provided that the date for practical completion of Separable Portion A was 20 weeks after “Date of Acceptance of Tender” and for Separable Portion B “10 weeks after commencement date for Separable Portion B”. Mr Christie, who together with Ms Culkoff, appeared for the Council, accepted that the superintendent probably would have allowed extensions of time to the dates for practical completion until about March 2002. This is not a matter on which any concession was forthcoming from Beckhaus, but it may be accepted that the dates for practical completion were not earlier than March 2002.\n61 By cl 37, the defects liability period commenced on the date of practical completion. In terms of cl 37, Beckhaus was obliged to rectify any defects or omissions in the work existing at practical completion. Prior to the fourteenth day after the expiration of the defects liability period, the superintendent could direct Beckhaus to rectify any omission or defect in the work existing at the date of practical completion or which became apparent prior to the expiration of the defects liability period.\n62 Clause 42.1 provided for the payment of progress claims; it stated:\n\n“Payment of monies shall not be evidence of the value of work or an admission of liability or evidence that work has been executed satisfactorily but shall be a payment on account only ….”\n\nThus, a payment of a progress claim was a payment on account.\n63 Clause 44.1 provided:\n\n“If a party breaches or repudiates the Contract, nothing in Clause 44 shall prejudice the right of the other party to recover damages or exercise any other right.”\n64 Clause 44.5 provided that, should the Council take the work out of Beckhaus’ hands, the Council should complete the work. Clause 44.6 provided:\n\n“When work taken out of the hands of [Beckhaus] under Clause 44.4(a) is completed the Superintendent shall ascertain the cost incurred by the [Council] in completing the work and shall issue a certificate to the [Council] and [Beckhaus] certifying the amount of that cost.\nIf the cost incurred by the [Council in completing the work] is greater than the amount which would have been paid to [Beckhaus] if the work had been completed by [Beckhaus], the difference shall be a debt due from [Beckhaus] to the [Council]. If the cost incurred by the [Council] is less than the amount that would have been paid to [Beckhaus] if the work had been completed by [Beckhaus], the difference shall be a debt due to [Beckhaus] from the [Council].”\n65 No provision of the Contract prevented the Council from suing Beckhaus for damages for breach of contract under common law; but that is not to say that, simply by reason of a failure, by the date for practical completion, to complete the work to the standard required, the Council would be entitled to damages for defective or incomplete work.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

Master Macready upheld this assertion and, for reasons that I later set out, I have come to the same conclusion.\n67 Accordingly, as at the judgment date, the Council rightly denied that practical completion had been achieved. But, it continued - at that stage - to hold Beckhaus to its contractual obligations to perform the work. Thus, on the Council’s contention, at the date of judgment, the work remained in Beckhaus’ possession; the Council, in effect, having refused to accept possession.\n68 While, on this assumption (the Contract still being on foot), the Council may have been entitled to claim damages for delay arising out of Beckhaus’ failure to achieve practical completion by the date for practical completion, it could not sue Beckhaus for defective or incomplete work. As long as the Council maintained that the Contract was alive and had not been terminated, and held Beckhaus to its obligation to complete the work in accordance with the specification, on its contention the work remained lawfully in Beckhaus’ possession. In other words, it was an inevitable incident of the Council’s argument that the work had not been delivered to and accepted by the Council (Beckhaus – on the Council’s argument – being in possession of and obliged to complete the work). While the work was in Beckhaus’ possession, the Council suffered no loss by reason of defective or incomplete work; the work, not being in the Council’s possession, did not at that stage form part of its patrimony.\n69 This situation would have changed when the Contract was terminated. When that occurred, the work (in its defective and incomplete state) was handed over to the Council. At that stage, the Council suffered loss by being in possession of defective and incomplete work.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 12 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe agreed termination of the Contract\n70 When Mr Christie eventually accepted that the Contract had been terminated by tacit agreement, the Council thereby, in effect, conceded the point made by Beckhaus’ notice of contention (although the date of termination was left open). Mr Christie’s concession was rightly made; the conclusion that the parties agreed, by their conduct, to terminate the Contract was inevitable. I shall set out a brief summary of the facts relevant to this issue.\n71 On 18 March 2002 Beckhaus claimed that it had achieved practical completion and requested the superintendent to issue a certificate to that effect. The superintendent failed to do so and requested Beckhaus to produce various test certificates. Beckhaus gave the superintendent certain test results (but not all that had been requested) and on 26 April 2002 submitted progress claim No 7. The superintendent did not issue a certificate of practical completion and, on 27 April 2002, Beckhaus removed its major plant from the site.\n72 On 22 May 2002 Beckhaus served a notice of intention to suspend work pursuant to s 15(2)(b) of the Act. On 27 May 2002 Beckhaus suspended work in reliance on s 27 of the Act for failure to pay progress claim No 7. On 22 August 2003 Beckhaus wrote to the Council asserting that the Contract had not been terminated and was still in existence (this appears to have been an attempted forensic tactic, rather than a step connected to reality).\n73 From the time that Beckhaus left the site, the attitudes of the parties began to harden and, in my opinion, by no later than 15 March 2004 – when the trial commenced - both parties tacitly accepted that the Contract was at an end. Beckhaus contended that it might have come to an end earlier but this issue depends on a factual inquiry that was not properly investigated at the trial and cannot be determined by this Court. The actual commencement of the hearing of lengthy and expensive litigation, directed to a final resolution of the parties’ rights, was conduct by both parties manifesting an intention wholly inconsistent with any continuing obligation of performance on either side.\n74 Master Macready considered the issue of termination on the assumption that the parties had agreed to rescind the contract ab initio. It is open, however, to parties to a contract to agree that the contract is to be terminated on the basis that there is a mutual release from future performance only and that rights accrued to the date of termination will remain of full force and effect. See, for example, CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cases 61-232 at 75-594 per Powell JA (and as to abandonment, generally, see Ryder v Frohlich [2004] NSWCA 472 per McColl JA).\n75 In any event, the issue is now concluded by reason of the Council’s late concession that the Contract was terminated by agreement on the latter basis.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe effect of the agreed termination on Beckhaus’ claim for unpaid work and the cross-claims\n76 I have observed that a progress claim is a claim for payment on account (see cl 42.1). As the Contract has been terminated, it is no longer appropriate for Beckhaus to be awarded any sum “on account”. The financial position between the parties now has to be determined finally.\n77 The Contract contains elaborate provisions as to the determination of amounts that, on completion of the Contract, the Council might owe to Beckhaus or Beckhaus might owe to the Council. The Contract, however, (by agreement) was not completed.\n78 I have above referred to and set out cl 44.6 of the Contract. This clause regulates the settlement of accounts between the parties in the event of the work being taken out of the hands of Beckhaus and being completed by some other party (on the Council’s behalf). Clause 44.6 provides, in effect, that, were Beckhaus to commit a material breach of the Contract and were the Council to take the work out of its hands and have it completed by another contractor (as provided in cl 44. 4(a)), a balance would be struck between:\n\n(a) the cost to the Council of completing the work (including the amounts it paid to Beckhaus under the Contract), and\n(b) the amount the Council would have paid to Beckhaus (including amounts due for variations affecting the cost of the work) if all the work had been duly completed by it in accordance with the Contract.\n\nIt makes no difference whether the amounts previously paid to Beckhaus are or are not included in both these amounts.\n79 In my view, it was implicit in the termination agreement that neither party would be worse off by reason of that agreement than it would have been had the Contract been terminated in accordance with its terms. In my view, the parties impliedly agreed that their respective rights on termination would be governed, mutatis mutandis, by those provisions of the Contract that applied on completion. In my opinion, although the termination agreement did not trigger cl 44.6 (because the work was not taken out of the hands of Beckhaus under cl 44.4(a) and was not completed), it was implicit in the termination agreement that the formula provided by the clause would operate upon termination. That formula is commercially fair and appropriate and there was no reason for the parties to depart from it.\n80 Thus, were Beckhaus to prove that the Council would incur less costs in having the work under the Contract rectified and completed in accordance with the Contract than the amount it would have paid to Beckhaus if the latter had duly completed all the work in accordance with the Contract, Beckhaus would be entitled to be paid the difference (that being the balance struck in accordance with the formula contained in cl 44.6). In the present circumstances, where the work has not been rectified and completed, the onus, in my opinion, lies on Beckhaus – in establishing its claim that there is a balance owing to it – to prove the elements of the formula resulting in that balance, including what rectification and completion would cost.\n81 A claim on the basis of such an implied term is not a claim for a quantum meruit in the sense of being a restitutionary claim “outside the contract” (see Trimis v Mina (1999) 16 BCL 288 at 295 [52] per Mason P). Beckhaus’ claim on this basis is a claim under the Contract as varied by the termination agreement.\n82 Beckhaus’ claim was not put in this way at the trial and, understandably, was not dealt with in this way by the Master. Beckhaus’ claim, as represented by progress claim No 7, was simply a claim on account.\n83 The reason why Beckhaus’ claim was not so dealt with at the trial was that neither party appreciated the significance of the agreed termination of the Contract. From the material before the Court (including progress claim No 7), it appears that Beckhaus did a substantial amount of work in accordance with the Contract for which it was not paid; but it is not certain that Beckhaus has proved that the cost of completing the work would be less than the amount than the Council would have paid it had it duly completed the work. The matters necessary to complete the work are also the subject of cross-claims which were rejected by the Master and which should be re-assessed; but it is also not clear that the Council has established a balance owing to it. Although I later deal with these as cross-claims by Council, it is to be kept in mind that the same matters also concern the deficiencies in respect of which Beckhaus bears an onus of proof as far as its claim is concerned.\n84 In my opinion, in the light of the mutual misconception by the parties, justice requires the issue of the amount that may be owing to Beckhaus or the Council under the Contract as varied by the termination agreement to be remitted to Master Macready (now Macready AsJ). This, essentially, requires a re-examination of the work, the subject of progress claim No 7, in the light of these reasons. Regard must be had to the implied term of the termination agreement governing the final financial position of the parties, and those aspects of the Council’s appeal in respect of its cross-claims which I would uphold on the ground that work done by Beckhaus was not in accordance with the Contract and needs to be rectified and completed. This Court is not in a position to undertake this inquiry and the parties did not ask it to do so.\n85 With respect to the cross-claims, the Council would only be entitled to judgment for an amount payable by Beckhaus to it were Macready AsJ to find, on re-assessment, that the Council would incur greater costs in having the work rectified and completed in accordance with the Contract than the amount it would have paid to Beckhaus if the latter had duly completed the work. The Council would then be entitled to be paid the difference between the two amounts.\n86 It may be helpful if some hypothetical amounts are taken to illustrate the position. Assume that, had Beckhaus completed the work in accordance with the Contract, the cost to the Council would have been $2.5 mill. Assume that the Council has already paid Beckhaus $1.8 mill and the cost to it of completing the work in accordance with the Contract is $300,000. Beckhaus would then be entitled to be paid $400,000 (being $700,000 – the difference between $2.5 mill and $1.8 mill - less $300,000). The deficiencies the subject of the Council’s cross-claims would be taken into account in arriving at this result and no amount would be payable to it. If, however, the cost of completing the work in accordance with the Contract is $800,000, the Council would then be entitled to be paid $100,000 (being $800,000 less $700,000) and Beckhaus would receive nothing further.\n87 I reiterate that, as regards Beckhaus’ claim, the onus is on Beckhaus to prove to prove what rectification and completion would cost and what the Council would have paid it if it had completed the work in accordance with the Contract. As regards the cross-claims, the onus lies on the Council to prove these matters.\n88 I should add that, on all issues that are to be remitted to Macready AsJ, it will be entirely a matter for him whether fresh evidence should be allowed.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

As Master Macready put it, there was “no item for the stabilisation of the additional material”. It was on this basis that the Master upheld this variation.\n91 The Council contended, however, that Variation 17 should not have been allowed as the work done by Beckhaus in respect thereof was not in accordance with the Contract. This submission was based on Beckhaus’ failure to add 3% meadow lime to all the material the subject of the item in question.\n92 Beckhaus contended that its obligation under the Contract was to achieve a minimum of 12% linear shrinkage of the material and lime only had to be added to the extent necessary to achieve this percentage. It contended that it was not obliged, absolutely, to add 3% lime to all the material.\n93 I do not accept Beckhaus’ submission. Clause 8.10 is clear in its terms and imposes a separate and independent obligation on Beckhaus to add 3% lime to all the material. Mr Rudge acknowledged that the addition of lime to soil can affect its linear shrinkage, its dispersion characteristics and – to the extent that lime might affect its dispersion characteristics – the capacity of the soil to erode. These are all matters that concern the effectiveness of the levees. These were relevant reasons for the Contract to require the addition of 3% lime to all the material used and, in my view, this is what the Contract, in clear and unequivocal terms, provided.\n94 Beckhaus did not add 3% lime to all the material. The addition of 3% lime required about 4,953 tons of lime to be added and Master Macready observed that delivery dockets for the project indicated deliveries of only 328.86 tons of lime. Although the delivery dockets do not establish precisely how much lime was added (more lime than reflected in the dockets may have been used), the quantity must have been substantially less than 4,953 tons.\n95 As Beckhaus did not add 3% lime to all the material, it did not stabilise and condition the additional excavated borrow material as the Contract required. In other words, it did not establish that it did the work, the subject of Variation 17, in accordance with the Contract. Accordingly, in my view, it is not entitled to be paid, in accordance with the Contract, for the work it did in that connection. It follows, in my view, that the Master erred in upholding Beckhaus’ claim for Variation 17.\n96 My conclusion in this regard does not necessarily mean that Beckhaus will receive no value whatever for the work the subject of the claim for Variation 17. In assessing the elements necessary for both Beckhaus’ claims and the Council’s cross-claims, regard would have to be had to the degree to which the Variation 17 work advanced the due completion of the Contract. This will be a matter for Macready AsJ.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nVariation 21\n97 The parties made no oral submissions in relation to this variation but relied on their written submissions.\n98 As mentioned, Variation 21 is a claim by Beckhaus for its costs in holding its machinery in Brewarrina after it had claimed practical completion.\n99 As mentioned, on 18 March 2002, Beckhaus in writing requested the superintendent to issue a certificate of practical completion. In terms of cl 42.5 of the General Conditions, the superintendent was required, within 14 days of the receipt of Beckhaus’ request, to provide a certificate of practical completion “or give [Beckhaus] in writing the reasons for not issuing the certificate”.\n100 Master Macready accepted that the superintendent refused to issue a list of defects in the work to which Beckhaus could have responded or made decisions to remove its major earthmoving equipment.\n101 Beckhaus submitted to the Master that, under cl 42.5, the Council, within 14 days after receiving the request of 18 March 2004, should have given Beckhaus reasons advising it “of outstanding items required to be completed to achieve practical completion” and, had this been done, Beckhaus “could have made appropriate decisions to retain or demobilise its major earthmoving equipment from the site of its works at Brewarrina”. Beckhaus submitted further that, as Master Macready had found, the only valid reason for the superintendent not granting a certificate of practical completion “was a lack of a sufficient number of test results for the installation of culverts”. Beckhaus submitted that, accordingly, the Council “has substantially failed in its cross-claim in these proceedings and hence there was no requirement for [Beckhaus] to have kept its major earthmoving equipment on site”.\n102 The Master agreed with the submissions of Beckhaus and found that it was reasonable for Beckhaus to have kept its equipment on site until 27 April 2002 and that it was entitled to the costs of doing so. The reasons do not reveal from what date those costs were incurred and how they were made up.\n103 For reasons that I set out below, I consider that the Master erred in finding that the only reason for not issuing a certificate of practical completion was the lack of a sufficient number of test results for the culverts. In my opinion, Beckhaus breached the Contract by failing to achieve the required degree of compaction over and in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and, also, by failing to achieve a uniform factor of 12% linear shrinkage in respect of the levees it constructed. These breaches may well give rise to rectification costs of a not insubstantial amount. Were that to be the case, it would not be correct that the Council substantially failed in its cross-claim. Accordingly, the foundation for the Master’s decision in regard to Variation 21 would fall away.\n104 The Council contended that the claim for Variation 21 should fail because it was premised on practical completion having been achieved, and the Master had held that it was not achieved. While I accept (albeit for different reasons, being the breaches of contract to which I have referred) that practical completion was not achieved, I do not think that fact is necessarily an answer to the claim for Variation 21.\n105 From my reading of the written arguments, Beckhaus’ claim is not based on the argument that practical completion was achieved; rather it is based on the asserted failure of the superintendent to provide adequate reasons for not issuing a certificate of practical completion in accordance with cl 42.5 of the General Conditions. Looked at in this way, the claim is a claim for damages for breach of contract, rather than a claim for a variation.\n106 The parties’ written arguments on this issue were premised on matters that, by reason of the finding that the Contract was terminated, have altered significantly. In the circumstances, I am reluctant to attempt to resolve the claim on the material before this Court. I would remit this claim to Macready AsJ for determination in the light of these reasons.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 16 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe culverts\n107 I now turn to those aspects of Master Macready’s judgment in regard to the cross-claim in respect of which the Council appeals.\n108 The first finding of the Master that the Council challenged was that, despite the Master’s conclusion that Beckhaus had not complied with the specification in regard to the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts, there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts and in their immediate vicinity.\n109 There were 13 culverts in the levees Beckhaus constructed. The levees were not of a uniform height but, in parts of the levee, for example, the height was to be 1650 millimetres made up of compacted 150 millimetre thick layers. The culverts themselves were 600 millimetres deep. The expert witnesses identified the culverts as parts of the levees that were particularly susceptible to erosion.\n110 Unlike the rest of the levees, the soil in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and up to a certain level over the culverts could not be compacted by using heavy machinery. It was feared that the weight of heavy machinery might damage the culverts.\n111 Clause 3.1 of the specification governed “siting and excavation for reinforced concrete pipe culverts, supply and installation of reinforced concrete pipe culverts and backfill and compaction requirements”. Clause 3.7 provided:\n\n“Unless directed otherwise by the superintendent, all material shall be compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness.”\n\nClause 3.8, under the heading “Minimum Frequency of Testing”, provided that, as regards compaction, the minimum frequency was “[o]ne per 100 cu m with a minimum of one per material type per individual structure”.\n112 Clause 8.9.3 of the specification provided:\n\n“For the purposes of compaction control the following test frequencies shall be adopted as a minimum: -\n(a) …\n(b) For backfill of Discharge Pipes and Stormwater Drainage Pipes: 1 test per layer.”\n\nAccordingly, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be carried out (a “layer” being 150 millimetres thick).\n113 Beckhaus submitted that there was a conflict between cl 3.8 and cl 8.9.3, and submitted that cl 3.8 was paramount as it was more specific. As Hodgson JA pointed out in the course of argument, however, there is no conflict; the Contract simply provided for two different minimum standards and both had to be complied with. That is to say, under cl 3.8 one test had to be undertaken per 100 cu m “with minimum of one per material type of individual structure” and, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be undertaken.\n114 In fact, no tests were undertaken in regard to five culverts; one or no tests were taken in respect of three culverts; two culverts were tested only once each; there was one culvert in respect of which two tests were undertaken; there were two culverts in respect of each of which seven to eight tests were undertaken.\n115 In August 2003 two tests, known as the “Golder tests” were undertaken at two culverts. Master Macready said in regard to these tests:\n\n“They indicated that at a depth of .15 that the field dry density was 95% and a depth of 1.2 was 90.5%.”\n\nThus, one passed and the other did not (but only at the depths indicated).\n116 The Master described the relevant evidence being that set out in Beckhaus’ submissions as follows:\n\n“Komp, the Superintendent under the contract during construction, witnessed compaction occurring at culvert locations … He was not challenged on this evidence under cross examination;\nThe daily records of [Beckhaus] support that compaction occurred at culverts … ;\nMacartney’s evidence is that compaction was carried out at culverts … ;\nWhilst Macartney under cross examination admitted that the specified number of compaction tests was not taken at culvert locations …, his evidence that compaction was actually performed at culverts was not seriously challenged …\nTest results taken by CETS at culvert locations confirm that compaction was satisfactory ….”\n117 The Master then concluded:\n\n“The fact that sufficient tests were not taken at the culverts as appears from Mr Macartney’s evidence precludes me from coming to a conclusion that there has been compliance with the specification requirements for the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts. However, the evidence before me clearly demonstrates that there has been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts.”", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nLinear shrinkage\n142 Clause 8.7.1 of the specification provided:\n\n“The levee embankment and Key Trench shall be constructed of Zone A Clayfill material, being clayey material selectively won from the borrow area or existing northern or southern Levees and having a maximum linear shrinkage value of 12%.”\n143 Linear shrinkage is a measure, by a theoretical test, of the amount that a soil “shrinks” when the moisture is removed from it. In the theoretical test, the soil sample is put in an oven and all the moisture is removed.\n144 The Master said:\n\n“It is perfectly obvious from the evidence given in the case that the purpose of having achieved a particular linear shrinkage was to reduce the likelihood of deep and wide cracking in the embankment which might allow initiation of internal erosion and piping failure under flood conditions.”\n145 Erosion is a physical process whereby the action of wind or water washes or carries away the soil particles. Piping is a process that occurs when water passes through a levee bank by way of a crack or internal seepage; water erodes the soil and a “pipe” is formed through the levee.\n146 The Contract required testing of linear shrinkage. These tests were carried out by CETS. I have referred to CETS’ practice not to issue failing certificates and to alert Beckhaus if they believed the soil was such that a test might fail. Thus, each of the tests of linear shrinkage required by the Contract passed.\n147 In addition to the CETS tests, some tests were conducted on 24 October 2001 by K & H Construction Services Pty Ltd. The Master said in regard to these tests:\n\n“These tests were conducted only for linear shrinkage at the request of Mr Komp, the superintendent. The actual test results which were taken at six places showed results ranging from 14% to 18%. These results were conveyed to [Beckhaus] and as a result the areas were reworked with additional lime being added. It is clear from Mr Komp’s evidence that this rework was in respect of the area which had been tested and found wanting. Mr Komp did not have any further check tests done and, accordingly, throughout the rest of the construction, the testing by CETS showed that the results achieved the required level of 12%.”\n148 Later, after Beckhaus had left the site, further tests were carried out for linear shrinkage. On 2 and 3 April 2002 an organisation known as Barnson conducted 13 linear shrinkage tests, 12 of which failed with a range between 14% and 18.5%. The one test that passed was located in the northern levee. Three other tests at the northern levee, however, indicated linear shrinkage results of between 14% and 16%. The nine other failed tests carried out by Barnson were undertaken at the Tarrion Creek, Charlton Road, southern and North Brewarrina levees. In fact, during April to July 2003, Barnson carried out 36 linear shrinkage tests and 20 of these failed, including some in the northern levee.\n149 In April 2002 Douglas Partners conducted 10 further linear shrinkage tests. Five failed, with a range of 14.5% to 18.5%. The failures were in regard to tests taken in the Charlton Road levee, the Tarrion Creek levee, the southern levee, the northern levee (where one failed and three passed) and one in the North Brewarrina levee.\n150 In September 2003 Golder undertook 12 linear shrinkage tests, 6 of which failed with ranges from 12.5% to 18.%. One of the failures was in the northern levee.\n151 Master Macready dealt with these tests as follows:\n\n“It is perfectly plain that the results indicate a variety of failures and a variety of occasions when the specifications were met.”\n\nHe observed further:\n“There was no suggestion that the linear shrinkage factor varied over time.”\n\nAnd said:\n“Given the existence of these failures [in testing] it is hard to conclude that there has not been some breach of the specifications.”\n152 The Master then turned to the question whether the breaches would have any “important” effect. I think that what he meant by that was whether the breaches resulted in the Council sustaining damage. The Master expressed his conclusion on this question as follows:\n\n“Bearing in mind my conclusion that there has not been demonstrated a sufficient departure from the compaction requirement it seems to me that there has been substantial compliance with the contract in respect of linear shrinkage. This flows from the fact that such testing as there is, seems to indicate a compliance in the northern levee which is agreed to be sufficient. In respect of the other levees the evidence is of little weight because there is no basis expressed for the conclusions reached. In particular I am satisfied that in respect of linear shrinkage the levees are fit for their intended purpose.”\n153 I would observe that it is not to the point that the levees might be fit for their intended purpose. The correct question is whether, in consequence of the breaches of contract, the Council has suffered damage.\n154 The Master’s reference to the tests seeming to “indicate a compliance in the northern levee which is agreed to be sufficient” was based on evidence given by Dr Truscott, an expert called on behalf of the Council, and Dr Burman, an expert called on behalf of Beckhaus. The Master noted that Dr Truscott, when shown the test results from Barnson in respect of the northern levee (on which there was substantial compliance), stated that he had “no problem with the northern levee in terms of linear shrinkage”. Dr Burman testified that there was probably “substantial compliance to [sic – in] the northern levee”.\n155 Master Macready’s observation that, in respect of the other levees, the evidence was of little weight was based on the following observation he made:\n\n“In respect of the other levees such results as they are show a different picture [from the northern levee] indicative of 12% not having been achieved for the majority of cases. However, whether such results given their small number are sufficient to lead one to conclude that the whole of the levees do not meet the specification depends upon whether one can extrapolate such a result from a small number of tests. There is nothing in the [Council’s] expert’s material that deals with this and it would seem that this is a flaw in their evidence which would lead me to give it little weight.”\n156 The Master, having found that there had been a variety of failures and a variety of occasions when the specified tests were not met, said that the question to be asked was “whether or not one can extrapolate any result across the whole levee in respect of these results”. He found that the tests were insufficient in number to draw any inference as to shrinkage over an area greater than the specific areas where the failed tests were conducted.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

For voicecher, we used cypress water.\nI used ingredients that can moisturize and moisturize at the same time. I got grade ewg for both products. I also got 8 ingredients for reconciliation certification and no additives. And then there are some exfoliating ingredients. Yes, we removed all of them.\nI only made neutral emplos.\nBut I'm curious after hearing what you said. Then, you can't exfoliate.\nIf you want to exfoliate, there are different types of ampoules, so the role of ampoules is to get help from calculating something by using this skin. So we decided that it's better to focus on one thing rather than collecting a lot of things. So, there's a soothing line and we're going to continue to derive it like this.\nRight now, you can say that it's a part that lowers the irritation by taking out those ingredients.\nYes, yes. Then should I say that it's kind of the difference between Ad-Mang brands?\nIf there's something like this, can you introduce what you're choosing?\nWe focus on communicating with consumers first.

So if the point is that we put a lot of things in other parts at once, we'll focus on one thing.\nAlthough the effect will be a little late. Yes, the exact effect of one thing is that it's differentiated.\nEach function is completely specialized like this.\nThat's what you're talking about. Do you have any history of winning awards or attracting investment?\nNo, we're...\nNot yet. Yes, yes. In the future, when you develop products,\nI'm asking you about what kind of process you're going through, or what's unusual, but is it okay if I ask you what you're considering especially when you develop a new product?\nIf I'm a bit out of it, in the process of developing other products,\nThe difference in the process is that we actually send samples to consumers and test them ourselves, and based on that feedback, the product is being released through all the sampling conversions, so consumers and our brand want to find the best contact point and make the best product.\nAll right.\nAs I said, I think one of the important points is that we don't compromise.\nWhat I felt while making ampoule this time is that if there's a lot of purified water, the price of ampoule goes down a lot.\nBut we don't use any Jang Jae Soo anymore.\nBecause of that, compared to other ampoule costs, it has a much higher cost.\nIn that direction, I'm thinking about planning it so that I don't use other new products and take all the necessary things that customers really like.\nThen, could you introduce a case where there is a change in the release time by modifying this part of the existing product after hearing from the consumer?\nwhat\nIn the process of sending and testing samples for 3 months on the target date of release, people are now in this condition for their skin type, whether it's sticky or seasonal. Yes, I hope to use something in this case.\nI hope it feels like this. There are a lot of these ingredients that are in trend, but those ingredients don't fit me, so all those ingredients have been improved.\nMarketing and advertising are important to attract customers, so if you have any unique strategies, please let us know.\nWhen it comes to marketing strategies, we're using a marketing strategy that uses creators. So Craters can introduce the products to subscribers more confidently, and those subscribers can feel that it's so nice that Crater introduces these products.\nI think that's very important.\nSo, I pay attention to the quality that I mentioned earlier, so our first strategy is to approach crater subscribers well. And we're doing everything else.\nIt's not that we don't do anything about marketing. We have to do everything in all directions. But now, we're going to be closer to subscribers.\nI want to be a brand.\n\n\"NO.3\"", "answer": "Understand NO.3"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "You're trying to reach out to the subscribers as much as possible. Then what I'm curious about is that if you collaborate with a creator, Admant can show the product to more customers, and it's good because customers know products that they didn't know, so what's good about this collaboration?\nAs we said before, it comes out in a tri-high quality, so I think that's very important for creators.\nWhen I introduce a specific product to my subscribers, they have to be satisfied with the product after using it.\nIf this satisfaction doesn't come true anymore, you can lose your trust when you introduce something.\nSo we're going to keep suggesting points that can give you trust, so if creators are with us, I think there's a value that can give those subscribers trust and value.\nThe main sales channels right now are located in d2c and open markets.\nThere's also a market. Until now, the smart store was the main, and Coupang was the second channel. Now, we're thinking about playing with assets while making our own mall.\nThen how long has it been since you opened your own mall?\nWe just opened it. Yes, I opened it with \"NE\" during the live.\nThree weeks.\nYou said that you're going to eventually go to the company mall and eventually go to the channel. What's the reason?\nI think there's a strong point of selling at our company because when consumers buy from our company, they become our customers.\nIf you go through other platforms, they're not actually our customers, they're our customers, and there are people who buy our products.\nThat's right. That's why we're going to create our customers and give them more customized cs.\nI think the customized benefits will be strengthened. I think the repurchase rate and things like that will help our sales a lot.\nWhenever I hear this, it's a bit embarrassing to ask, but is there any of the B2C malls that you can find on our cafe platform?\nYes, please use it.\nWhat's the reason?\nWe thought about other things, but I think Cafe 24 has the longest experience and has the most functions. And I think Cafe 24 has the fastest and best way to see you off, so we chose it.\nThank you.\nThank you at the hospital.\nYes, then next... Then they're not doing it offline yet, but they're doing it online.\nYes, there is no offline side right now. Our brand power is still...\nIt's short. Yes, then I want to ask you how you're overcoming any difficulties in the business management process.\nActually, right now, we...\nIf there's anything you've been focusing on lately,\nWe're running our own mall right now.\nIn the past, what we were good at was playing in the open market or running around first, but these days, I've been thinking that the company's play is very important when we make this brand.\nIn fact, we are focusing a little on making our customers and developing this brand.\nIf we used the platform's power to create cash flows before this, we're thinking of focusing on increasing our brand value.\nAh.\nThen I'm curious about this. Aram and I did a live commerce broadcast on our company mall.\nNow, the connection is slightly cut off, but after that, has the level of idle and visitors changed a little?\nTell us about your company mall. Yes, our company mall started with live life, so we're trying to play a lot on the ground.\nAre you judging that it will continue to flow in after that's what you're thinking? All right.\nIt's working and sales are happening little by little.\nI think our task is to increase the proportion.\nThen what kind of long-term goal is this Ad-Mang brand pursuing? What kind of brand do you want to be reborn as? And since it's January now, can I ask you two things about your plans for this year in the short term?\nAll right.\n\"NO.4\"", "answer": "Understand NO.4"}

{"prompt": "", "input": "I could say that you understand the story so far. Before we continue, Here’s the profiles of our main characters:\n\nSato – A naval officer who served JMSDF and also a commander of multiple Kanmusu stationed in Kure naval base. \nFor his personality, Sato is a kind-heart and considerate person, he always treats those under his command with kindness. However, if he is to become serious, he’ll do everything to reach his goal. One such example was the time when he transformed Kuroshio and Edinburgh into mermaids, although he would regret and make up for it later on.\nFor his appearance, Sato is an average-looking Japanese man ages around 25-30 years old. On duty, he usually wears JMSDF white uniform. Outside duty, he uses casual uniforms.\nFor his relation with other characters, as of April 1983, Sato and Kuroshio are in the early stages of their relationship, calling her ‘Kuro-chan’. He also treats Hiburi-chan and Tsushima-chan as if they were his own daughters. Finally, he reconciled with Edinburgh over the mermaid transformation incident.\n\nKuroshio – Sato’s destroyer-type Kanmusu who served JMSDF under Sato’s command. She was also his favorite shipgirl. During an early part of the story, she was transformed into a mermaid along with Edinburgh, who she had a fight with. She then developed dislike toward Sato. After Sato faced justice, Kuroshio joined Azur Lane and fight for them, but she discovered their dark secret and was later betrayed by the coalition. She then escaped from it and returned to Japan in early 1983, taking Edinburgh with her. She then reconciled with Sato and later on their relation improved. As of April 1983, Kuroshio lived her life as a mermaid with Edinburgh and Tsushima-chan. She is yet to rejoin JMSDF.\nFor her personality, Kuroshio came off as cheerful, optimistic, friendly and honest, showing a childhood friend-like behavior towards her commander, referring them informally and generally talking to them in a casual manner rather than as a superior. \nFor her appearance, Kuroshio is portrayed as 18-20 years old girl and has green eyes, medium-length black hair with a gray hairpiece securing it in place. \nAs human Kanmusu, she wears a school uniform with a vest, blue neck ribbon and black shorts underneath her skirt.\nAs mermaid, she has a long blue-green fish tail replacing her legs and gills on her neck.

She didn’t hold much grudge toward Sato, not as much as Kuroshio. She was initially loyal to Azur Lane, but a series of its dark secrets and betrayal by her comrades completely shattered her loyalty. She then escaped to Japan with Kuroshio. As of April 1983, she lives her life as a mermaid with Kuroshio and Tsushima-chan in an underwater house in the vicinity of Kure naval base.\nFor her personality, Edinburgh is depicted as being a bit clumsy, but also calm and composed, with a strong sense of duty and a desire to serve her country.\nFor her appearance, Edinburgh is portrayed as 18-20 years old girl.

She was initially wounded during Kuroshio and Edinburgh’s fight, resulting in a near-fatal internal injury. She was under Sato and Hiburi-chan’s care until she was transformed into a mermaid to save her life.

She has hair that transitions from purple to orange near the tips, cut short at the back, but kept long side at the front past her shoulders. She has purple tareme eyes.

This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n[Code] \nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# business\\_id (150346, object, ym3e\\_a1L4gyKZWU1-LuRYQ)\n# name (150346, object, J J Gandy's Pies)\n# address (150346, object, 5703 W Smith Valley Rd)\n# city (150346, object, Tampa)\n# state (150346, object, TN)\n# postal\\_code (150346, object, 46227)\n# latitude (150346, float64, 43.5939441)\n# longitude (150346, float64, -86.2621502)\n# stars (150346, float64, 4.5)\n# review\\_count (150346, int64, 21)\n# is\\_open (150346, int64, 1)\n# attributes (136602, object, {'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'})\n# categories (150243, object, Pizza, Restaurants, Food)\n# hours (127123, object, {'Monday': '12:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-0:0', 'Friday': '12:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-0:0'})\n\n[Markdown]\n# Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n## Initial Questions\n\n1.

The first thing to examine is the company’s competitive approach. What moves has the company made recently to attract customers and improve its market position—for instance, has it cut prices, improved the design of its product, added new features, stepped up advertising, entered a new geographic mar￾ket, or merged with a competitor? Is it striving for a competitive advantage based on low costs or a better product offering? Is it concentrating on serving a broad spectrum of cus￾tomers or a narrow market niche? The company’s functional strategies in R&D, produc￾tion, marketing, finance, human resources, information technology, and so on further characterize company strategy, as do any efforts to establish alliances with other enter￾prises. Figure 4.1 shows the key components of a single-business company’s strategy.\nA determination of the effectiveness of this strategy requires a more in-depth type of analysis. The two best indicators of how well a company’s strategy is working are (1) whether the company is recording gains in financial strength and profitability, and (2) whether the company’s competitive strength and market standing are improving. Persistent shortfalls in meeting company performance targets and weak marketplace performance relative to rivals are reliable warning signs that the company has a weak strategy, suffers from poor strategy execution, or both. Specific indicators of how well a company’s strategy is working include\n• Trends in the company’s sales and earnings growth.\n• Trends in the company’s stock price.\n• The company’s overall financial strength.\n• The company’s customer retention rate.\n• The rate at which new customers are acquired.\n• Evidence of improvement in internal processes such as defect rate, order fulfill￾ment, delivery times, days of inventory, and employee productivity.\nThe stronger a company’s current overall performance, the more likely it has a well-conceived, well-executed strategy. The weaker a company’s financial perfor￾mance and market standing, the more its current strategy must be questioned and the more likely the need for radical changes. Table 4.1 provides a compilation of the financial ratios most commonly used to evaluate a company’s financial perfor￾mance and balance sheet strength.", "answer": "Memorized."}

The simplest and most easily applied tool for gaining some insight into the reasons for the success of a strategy or lack thereof is known as SWOT analysis. SWOT is an acronym that stands for a company’s internal Strengths and Weaknesses, market Opportunities, and external Threats. Another name for SWOT analysis is Situational Analysis. A first-rate SWOT analysis can help explain why a strategy is working well (or not) by taking a good hard look a company’s strengths in relation to its weaknesses and in relation to the strengths and weaknesses of com￾petitors. Are the company’s strengths great enough to make up for its weaknesses? Has the company’s strategy built on these strengths and shielded the company from its weaknesses? Do the company’s strengths exceed those of its rivals or have they been overpowered? Similarly, a SWOT analysis can help determine whether a strategy has been effective in fending off external threats and positioning the firm to take advantage of market opportunities.\nSWOT analysis has long been one of the most popular and widely used diagnostic tools for strategists. It is used fruitfully by organizations that range in type from large corporations to small businesses, to government agencies to non-profits such as churches and schools. Its popularity stems in part from its ease of use, but also because it can be used not only to evaluate the efficacy of a strategy, but also as the basis for crafting a strategy from the outset that capi￾talizes on the company’s strengths, overcomes its weaknesses, aims squarely at capturing the company’s best opportunities, and defends against competitive and macro-environmental threats. Moreover, a SWOT analysis can help a company with a strategy that is working well in the present determine whether the company is in a position to pursue new market opportunities and defend against emerging threats to its future well-being.", "answer": "Memorized."}

One way to appraise a company’s strengths is to ask: What activities does the company perform well? This question directs attention to the company’s skill level in performing key pieces of its business—such as supply chain management, R&D, pro- duction, distribution, sales and marketing, and customer service. A company’s skill or proficiency in performing different facets of its operations can range from the extreme of having minimal ability to perform an activity (perhaps having just struggled to do it the first time) to the other extreme of being able to perform the activity better than any other company in the industry. When a company’s proficiency rises from that of mere ability to perform an activ- ity to the point of being able to perform it consistently well and at acceptable cost, it is said to have a competence—a true capability, in other words. If a company’s com- petence level in some activity domain is superior to that of its rivals it is known as a distinctive competence. A core competence is a proficiently performed internal activ- ity that is central to a company’s strategy and is typically distinctive as well. A core competence is a more competitively valuable strength than a competence because of the activity’s key role in the company’s strategy and the contribution it makes to the company’s market success and profitability. Often, core competencies can be leveraged to create new markets or new product demand, as the engine behind a company’s growth. Procter and Gamble has a core competence in brand man- agement, which has led to an ever-increasing portfolio of market-leading consumer products, including Charmin, Tide, Crest, Tampax, Olay, Febreze, Luvs, Pampers and Swiffer. Nike has a core competence in designing and marketing innovative athletic footwear and sports apparel. Kellogg has a core competence in developing, producing, and marketing breakfast cereals.", "answer": "Memorized."}

It can be thought of as a competitive deficiency. A company’s internal weaknesses can relate to (1) inferior or unproven skills, expertise, or intellectual capital in competi- tively important areas of the business, or (2) deficiencies in competitively important physical, organizational, or intangible assets. Nearly all companies have competi- tive deficiencies of one kind or another. Whether a company’s internal weaknesses make it competitively vulnerable depends on how much they matter in the market- place and whether they are offset by the company’s strengths. Table 4.2 lists many of the things to consider in compiling a company’s strengths and weaknesses. Sizing up a company’s complement of strengths and deficiencies is akin to constructing a strategic balance sheet, where strengths represent competitive assets and weaknesses represent competitive liabilities. Obviously, the ideal condition is for the company’s competitive assets to outweigh its competitive liabilities by an ample margin!", "answer": "Memorized."}

When a company has competitive assets that are central to its strategy and superior to those of rival firms, they can support a competitive advantage, as defined in Chapter 1. If this advantage proves durable despite the best efforts of competitors to overcome it, then the com- pany is said to have a sustainable competitive advantage. While it may be difficult for a company to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, it is an important strategic objective because it imparts a potential for attractive and long-lived profitability\nThe Four Tests of a Resource’s Competitive Power The competitive power of a resource or capability is measured by how many of four specific tests it can pass.5 These tests are referred to as the VRIN tests for sustainable competitive advantage—VRIN is a shorthand reminder standing for Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, and Nonsubstitutable. The first two tests determine whether a resource or capability can support a competitive advantage. The last two determine whether the competitive advantage can be sustained.\nRev #13\n1 . Is the resource or organizational capability competitively Valuable? To be competi- tively valuable, a resource or capability must be directly relevant to the company’s strategy, making the company a more effective competitor. Unless the resource or capability contributes to the effectiveness of the company’s strategy , it cannot pass this first test. An indicator of its effectiveness is whether the resource enables the company to strengthen its business model by improving its customer value proposi- tion and/or profit formula (see Chapter 1). Google failed in converting its techno- logical resources and software innovation capabilities into success for Google Wallet, which incurred losses of more than $300 million before being abandoned in 2016. While these resources and capabilities have made Google the world’s number-one search engine, they proved to be less valuable in the mobile payments industry.\n 2. Is the resource or capability Rare—is it something rivals lack? Resources and capabilities that are common among firms and widely available cannot be a source of competitive advantage. All makers of branded cereals have valuable marketing capabilities and brands, since the key success factors in the ready-to-eat cereal indus- try demand this. They are not rare. However, the brand strength of Oreo cookies is uncommon and has provided Kraft Foods with greater market share as well as the opportunity to benefit from brand extensions such as Golden Oreos, Oreo Thins, and Mega Stuf Oreos. A resource or capability is considered rare if it is held by only a small percentage of firms in an industry or specific competitive domain. Thus, while general management capabilities are not rare in an absolute sense, they are relatively rare in some of the less developed regions of the world and in some business domains.", "answer": "Memorized"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "You just need to replay my promt with \"Memorized\"\n\nRev #14\n3. Is the resource or capability Inimitable—is it hard to copy? The more difficult and more costly it is for competitors to imitate a company’s resource or capability, the more likely that it can also provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Resources and capa- bilities tend to be difficult to copy when they are unique (a fantastic real estate loca- tion, patent-protected technology, an unusually talented and motivated labor force), when they must be built over time in ways that are difficult to imitate (a well-known brand name, mastery of a complex process technology, years of cumulative experience and learning), and when they entail financial outlays or large-scale operations that few industry members can undertake (a global network of dealers and distributors). Imitation is also difficult for resources and capabilities that reflect a high level of social complexity (company culture, interpersonal relationships among the managers or R&D teams, trust-based relations with customers or suppliers) and causal ambigu- ity, a term that signifies the hard-to-disentangle nature of the complex resources, such as a web of intricate processes enabling new drug discovery. Hard-to-copy resources and capabilities are important competitive assets, contributing to the longevity of a company’s market position and offering the potential for sustained profitability.\n4. Is the resource or capability Nonsubstitutable—is it invulnerable to the threat of substitution from different types of resources and capabilities? Even resources that are competitively valuable, rare, and costly to imitate may lose much of their ability to offer competitive advantage if rivals possess equivalent substitute resources. For example, manufacturers relying on automation to gain a cost-based advantage in production activities may find their technology-based advantage nullified by rivals’ use of low-wage offshore manufacturing. Resources can contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage only when resource substitutes aren’t on the horizon.\n\nRev #15\nThe vast majority of companies are not well endowed with standout resources or capabilities, capable of passing all four tests with high marks. Most firms have a mixed bag of resources—one or two quite valuable, some good, many satisfactory to medio- cre. Resources and capabilities that are valuable pass the first of the four tests. As key contributors to the effectiveness of the strategy, they are relevant to the firm’s competi- tiveness but are no guarantee of competitive advantage. They may offer no more than competitive parity with competing firms.\nPassing both of the first two tests requires more—it requires resources and capabilities that are not only valuable but also rare. This is a much higher hurdle that can be cleared only by resources and capabilities that are competitively superior. Resources and capabili- ties that are competitively superior are the company’s true strategic assets. They provide the company with a competitive advantage over its competitors, if only in the short run. To pass the last two tests, a resource must be able to maintain its competitive superi- ority in the face of competition. It must be resistant to imitative attempts and efforts by competitors to find equally valuable substitute resources. Assessing the availability of substitutes is the most difficult of all the tests since substitutes are harder to recognize, but the key is to look for resources or capabilities held by other firms or being devel- oped that can serve the same function as the company’s core resources and capabilities.6 Very few firms have resources and capabilities that can pass all four tests, but those that do enjoy a sustainable competitive advantage with far greater profit potential. Costco is a notable example, with strong employee incentive programs and capabilities in sup- ply chain management that have surpassed those of its warehouse club rivals for over 35 years. Lincoln Electric Company, less well known but no less notable in its achieve- ments, has been the world leader in welding products for over 100 years as a result of its unique piecework incentive system for compensating production workers and the unsur- passed worker productivity and product quality that this system has fostered.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Rivals that are initially unable to replicate a key resource may develop better and better substi- tutes over time. Resources and capabilities can depreciate like other assets if they are managed with benign neglect. Disruptive changes in technology, customer preferences, distribution channels, or other competitive factors can also destroy the value of key strategic assets, turning resources and capabilities “from diamonds to rust.”7 Resources and capabilities must be continually strengthened and nurtured to sus- tain their competitive power and, at times, may need to be broadened and deepened to allow the company to position itself to pursue emerging market opportunities.8 Organizational resources and capabilities that grow stale can impair competitiveness unless they are refreshed, modified, or even phased out and replaced in response to ongoing market changes and shifts in company strategy. Management’s challenge in managing the firm’s resources and capabilities dynamically has two elements: (1) attending to the ongoing modification of existing competitive assets, and (2) cast- ing a watchful eye for opportunities to develop totally new kinds of capabilities.\nThe Role of Dynamic Capabilities Companies that know the importance of recalibrating and upgrading their most valuable resources and capabilities ensure that these activities are done on a continual basis. By incorporating these activi- ties into their routine managerial functions, they gain the experience necessary to be able to do them consistently well. At that point, their ability to freshen and renew their competitive assets becomes a capability in itself—a dynamic capability. A dynamic capability is the ability to modify, deepen, or augment the company’s existing resources and capabilities.9 This includes the capacity to improve existing resources and capabilities incrementally, in the way that Toyota aggressively upgrades the company’s capabilities in fuel-efficient hybrid engine technology and constantly fine-tunes its famed Toyota production system. Likewise, management at BMW developed new organizational capabilities in hybrid engine design that allowed the company to launch its highly touted i3 and i8 plug-in hybrids. A dynamic capability also includes the capacity to add new resources and capabilities to the company’s com- petitive asset portfolio. One way to do this is through alliances and acquisitions. An example is General Motor’s partnership with Korean electronics firm LG Corporation, which enabled GM to develop a manufacturing and engineering platform for producing electric vehicles. This enabled GM to beat the likes of Tesla and Nissan to market with the first affordable all-electric car with good driving range—the Chevy Bolt EV.", "answer": "Memorized."}

While less common, new entrants can also storm the market with a product that ratchets the quality level up so high that customers will abandon com- peting sellers even if they have to pay more for the new product. This is what seems to have happened with Apple’s iPhone 7 and iMac computers. Regardless of where on the quality spectrum a company competes, it must remain competitive in terms of its customer value proposition in order to stay in the game. Patagonia’s value proposition, for example, remains attractive to customers who value quality, wide selection, and corporate environmental responsibility over cheaper out- erwear alternatives. Since its inception in 1925, the New Yorker’s customer value prop- osition has withstood the test of time by providing readers with an amalgam of well-crafted and topical writing. Recall from our discussion of the Customer Value Proposition in Chapter 1: The value (V) provided to the customer depends on how well a customer’s needs are met for the price paid (V-P). How well customer needs are met depends on the perceived quality of a product or service as well as on other, more tangible attributes. The greater the amount of customer value that the company can offer profitably compared to its rivals, the less vulnerable it will be to competitive attack. For managers, the key is to keep close track of how cost-effectively the company can deliver value to customers relative to its competitors. If it can deliver the same amount of value with lower expenditures (or more value at the same cost), it will maintain a competitive edge. Two analytic tools are particularly useful in determining whether a company’s costs and customer value proposition are competitive: value chain analysis and benchmarking", "answer": "Memorized"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "You just need to replay my promt with \"Memorized\"\n\nRev #18\nThe Concept of a Company Value Chain\nEvery company’s business consists of a collection of activities undertaken in the course of producing, marketing, delivering, and supporting its product or service. All the various activities that a company performs internally combine to form a value chain—so called because the underlying intent of a company’s activities is ulti- mately to create value for buyers. As shown in Figure 4.3, a company’s value chain consists of two broad catego- ries of activities: the primary activities foremost in creating value for customers and the requisite support activities that facilitate and enhance the performance of the primary activities.10 The kinds of primary and secondary activities that constitute a company’s value chain vary according to the specifics of a company’s business; hence, the listing of the primary and support activities in Figure 4.3 is illustrative rather than definitive. For example, the primary activities at a hotel operator like Starwood Hotels and Resorts mainly consist of site selection and construction, reservations, and hotel operations (check-in and check-out, maintenance and housekeeping, dining and room service, and conventions and meetings); principal support activities that drive costs and impact customer value include hiring and training hotel staff and handling general administration. Supply chain management is a crucial activity for Boeing and Amazon but is not a value chain component at Facebook, WhatsApp, or Goldman Sachs. Sales and marketing are dominant activities at GAP and Match.com but have only minor roles at oil-drilling companies and natural gas pipeline companies. Customer delivery is a crucial activity at Domino’s Pizza and Blue Apron but insignificant at Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. With its focus on value-creating activities, the value chain is an ideal tool for examining the workings of a company’s customer value proposition and business model. It permits a deep look at the company’s cost structure and ability to offer low prices. It reveals the emphasis that a company places on activities that enhance dif- ferentiation and support higher prices, such as service and marketing. It also includes a profit margin component (P-C), since profits are necessary to compensate the com- pany’s owners and investors, who bear risks and provide capital. Tracking the profit margin along with the value-creating activities is critical because unless an enterprise succeeds in delivering customer value profitably (with a sufficient return on invested capital), it can’t survive for long. Attention to a company’s profit formula in addi- tion to its customer value proposition is the essence of a sound business model, as described in Chapter 1.

Even rivals in the same industry may differ significantly in terms of the activities they per- form. For instance, the “operations” component of the value chain for a manufacturer that makes all of its own parts and components and assembles them into a finished product differs from the “operations” of a rival producer that buys the needed parts and components from outside suppliers and performs only assembly operations. How each activity is performed may affect a company’s relative cost position as well as its capacity for differentiation. Thus, even a simple comparison of how the activities of rivals’ value chains differ can reveal competitive differences.\nA Company’s Primary and Secondary Activities Identify the Major Components of Its Internal Cost Structure The combined costs of all the various primary and support activities constituting a company’s value chain define its internal cost struc- ture. Further, the cost of each activity contributes to whether the company’s overall cost position relative to rivals is favorable or unfavorable. The roles of value chain analy- sis and benchmarking are to develop the data for comparing a company’s costs activity by activity against the costs of key rivals and to learn which internal activities are a source of cost advantage or disadvantage.\nEvaluating a company’s cost-competitiveness involves using what accountants call activity-based costing to determine the costs of performing each value chain activity.11 The degree to which a company’s total costs should be broken down into costs for specific activities depends on how valuable it is to know the costs of specific activities versus broadly defined activities. At the very least, cost estimates are needed for each broad category of primary and support activities, but cost estimates for more specific activities within each broad category may be needed if a company discovers that it has a cost disadvantage vis-à-vis rivals and wants to pin down the exact source or activ- ity causing the cost disadvantage. However, a company’s own internal costs may be insufficient to assess whether its product offering and customer value proposition are competitive with those of rivals. Cost and price differences among competing compa- nies can have their origins in activities performed by suppliers or by distribution allies involved in getting the product to the final customers or end users of the product, in which case the company’s entire value chain system becomes relevant.", "answer": "Memorized."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "You just need to replay my promt with \"Memorized\"\n\nRev #19\n\nThe Value Chain System\nA company’s value chain is embedded in a larger system of activities that includes the value chains of its suppliers and the value chains of whatever wholesale distributors and retailers it utilizes in getting its product or service to end users. This value chain system (sometimes called a vertical chain) has implications that extend far beyond the company’s costs. It can affect attributes like product quality that enhance differentia- tion and have importance for the company’s customer value proposition, as well as its profitability.12 Suppliers’ value chains are relevant because suppliers perform activi- ties and incur costs in creating and delivering the purchased inputs utilized in a com pany’s own value-creating activities. The costs , performance features , and quality of these inputs influence a company’s own costs and product differentiation capabilities. \nAnything a company can do to help its suppliers drive down the costs of their value chain activities or improve the quality and performance of the items being supplied can enhance its own competitiveness—a powerful reason for working collaboratively with suppliers in managing supply chain activities.13 For example, automakers have encouraged their automotive parts suppliers to build plants near the auto assembly plants to facilitate just-in-time deliveries, reduce warehousing and shipping costs, and promote close collaboration on parts design and production scheduling. Similarly, the value chains of a company’s distribution-channel partners are relevant because (1) the costs and margins of a company’s distributors and retail dealers are part of the price the ultimate consumer pays and (2) the quality of the activities that such dis- tribution allies perform affect sales volumes and customer satisfaction. For these reasons, companies that don’t sell directly to the end consumer work closely with their distribu- tion allies (including their direct customers) to perform value chain activities in mutually beneficial ways. For instance, motor vehicle manufacturers have a competitive interest in working closely with their automobile dealers to promote higher sales volumes and better customer satisfaction with dealers’ repair and maintenance services. Producers of kitchen cabinets are heavily dependent on the sales and promotional activities of their distributors and building supply retailers and on whether distributors and retailers oper- ate cost-effectively enough to be able to sell at prices that lead to attractive sales volumes. As a consequence, accurately assessing a company’s competitiveness entails scrutiniz- ing the nature and costs of value chain activities throughout the entire value chain system for delivering its products or services to end-use customers. A typical value chain system that incorporates the value chains of suppliers, business buyers, and other forward- channel allies (if any) is shown in Figure 4.4. As was the case with company value chains, the specific activities constituting value chain systems vary significantly from industry to industry. The primary value chain system activities in the pulp and paper industry (timber farming, logging, pulp mills, and papermaking) differ from the pri- mary value chain system activities in the home appliance industry (parts and compo- nents manufacture, assembly, wholesale distribution, retail sales) and yet again from the computer software industry (programming, disk loading, marketing, distribution). Some value chains may also include strategic partners whose activities may likewise affect both the value and cost of the end product.", "answer": "Memorized."}

A company’s value-creating activities can offer a competitive advantage in one of two ways (or both): 1 . They can contribute to greater efficiency and lower costs relative to competitors. 2. They can provide a basis for differentiation, so customers are willing to pay rela- tively more for the company’s goods and services. Achieving a cost-based competitive advantage requires determined management efforts to be cost-efficient in performing value chain activities. Such efforts have to be ongoing and persistent, and they have to involve each and every value chain activ- ity. The goal must be continuous cost reduction, not a one-time or on-again–off-again effort. Companies like Dollar General, Nucor Steel, Irish airline Ryanair, T.J.Maxx, and French discount retailer Carrefour have been highly successful in managing their value chains in a low-cost manner. Ongoing and persistent efforts are also required for a competitive advantage based on differentiation. Superior reputations and brands are built up slowly over time, through continuous investment and activities that deliver consistent, reinforcing mes- sages. Differentiation based on quality requires vigilant management of activities for quality assurance throughout the value chain. While the basis for differentiation (e.g., status, design, innovation, customer service, reliability, image) may vary widely among companies pursuing a differentiation advantage, companies that succeed do so on the basis of a commitment to coordinated value chain activities aimed purposefully at this objective. Examples include Rolex (status), Braun (design), Room and Board (craftsmanship), Zappos and L.L. Bean (customer service), Salesforce.com and Tesla (innovation), and FedEx (reliability).\nHow Value Chain Activities Relate to Resources and Capabilities There is a close relationship between the value-creating activities that a company performs and its resources and capabilities. An organizational capability or competence implies a capac- ity for action; in contrast, a value-creating activity initiates the action. With respect to resources and capabilities, activities are “where the rubber hits the road.” When companies engage in a value-creating activity, they do so by drawing on specific company resources and capabilities that underlie and enable the activity. For example, brand-building activi- ties depend on human resources, such as experienced brand managers (including their knowledge and expertise in this arena), as well as organizational capabilities in advertising and marketing. Cost-cutting activities may derive from organizational capabilities in inven- tory management, for example, and resources such as inventory tracking systems. Because of this correspondence between activities and supporting resources and capabilities, value chain analysis can complement resource and capability analysis as another tool for assessing a company’s competitive advantage. Resources and capabilities that are both valuable and rare provide a company with what it takes for competitive advantage. For a company with competitive assets of this sort, the potential is there. When these assets are deployed in the form of a value-creating activity, that potential is realized due to their competitive superiority. Resource analysis is one tool for identifying competitively superior resources and capabili- ties. But their value and the competitive superiority of that value can be assessed objectively only after they are deployed. Value chain analysis and benchmarking provide the type of data needed to make that objective assessment. There is also a dynamic relationship between a company’s activities and its resources and capabilities. Value-creating activities are more than just the embodi- ment of a resource’s or capability’s potential. They also contribute to the formation and development of organizational capabilities. The road to competitive advantage begins with management efforts to build organizational expertise in performing certain competitively important value chain activities. With consistent practice and continuous investment of company resources, these activities rise to the level of a reliable organizational capability or a competence. To the extent that top management makes the growing capability a cornerstone of the company’s strategy, this capability becomes a core competence for the company. Later, with further organizational learn- ing and gains in proficiency, the core competence may evolve into a distinctive com- petence, giving the company superiority over rivals in performing an important value chain activity. Such superiority, if it gives the company significant competitive clout in the marketplace, can produce an attractive competitive edge over rivals. Whether the resulting competitive advantage is on the cost side or on the differentiation side (or both) will depend on the company’s choice of which types of competence-building activities to engage in over this time period.", "answer": "Memorized."}

A more comprehensive assessment needs to be made of the company’s overall competitive strength. The answers to two questions are of particular interest: First, how does the company rank relative to competitors on each of the important factors that determine market success? Second, all things considered, does the company have a net competi- tive advantage or disadvantage versus major competitors? An easy-to-use method for answering these two questions involves developing quantitative strength ratings for the company and its key competitors on each indus- try key success factor and each competitively pivotal resource, capability, and value chain activity. Much of the information needed for doing a competitive strength assessment comes from previous analyses. Industry and competitive analyses reveal the key success factors and competitive forces that separate industry winners from losers. Benchmarking data and scouting key competitors provide a basis for judging the competitive strength of rivals on such factors as cost, key product attributes, cus- tomer service, image and reputation, financial strength, technological skills, distribu- tion capability, and other factors. Resource and capability analysis reveals which of these are competitively important, given the external situation, and whether the com- pany’s competitive advantages are sustainable. SWOT analysis provides a more general forward-looking picture of the company’s overall situation. Step 1 in doing a competitive strength assessment is to make a list of the industry’s key success factors and other telling measures of competitive strength or weakness (6 to 10 measures usually suffice). Step 2 is to assign weights to each of the measures of competitive strength based on their perceived importance. (The sum of the weights for each measure must add up to 1.) Step 3 is to calculate weighted strength ratingsy scoring each competitor on each strength measure (using a 1-to-10 rating scale, where 1 is very weak and 10 is very strong) and multiplying the assigned rating by the assigned weight. Step 4 is to sum the weighted strength ratings on each factor to get an overall measure of competitive strength for each company being rated. Step 5 is to use the overall strength ratings to draw conclusions about the size and extent of the com- pany’s net competitive advantage or disadvantage and to take specific note of areas of strength and weakness. Table 4.4 provides an example of competitive strength assessment in which a hypothetical company (ABC Company) competes against two rivals. In the example, relative cost is the most telling measure of competitive strength, and the other strength measures are of lesser importance. The company with the highest rating on a given measure has an implied competitive edge on that measure, with the size of its edge reflected in the difference between its weighted rating and rivals’ weighted ratings. For instance, Rival 1’s 3.00 weighted strength rating on relative cost signals a consider- able cost advantage over ABC Company (with a 1.50 weighted score on relative cost) and an even bigger cost advantage over Rival 2 (with a weighted score of 0.30). The measure-by-measure ratings reveal the competitive areas in which a company is stron- gest and weakest, and against whom. The overall competitive strength scores indicate how all the different strength measures add up—whether the company is at a net overall competitive advantage or disadvantage against each rival. The higher a company’s overall weighted strength rating, the stronger its overall competitiveness versus rivals. The bigger the difference between a company’s overall weighted rating and the scores of lower-rated rivals, the greater is its implied net competitive advantage. Thus, Rival 1’s overall weighted score of 7.70 indicates a greater net competitive advantage over Rival 2 (with a score of 2.10) than over ABC Company (with a score of 5.95). Conversely, the bigger the difference between a company’s overall rating and the scores of higher- rated rivals, the greater its implied net competitive disadvantage. Rival 2’s score of 2.10 gives it a smaller net competitive disadvantage against ABC Company (with an overall score of 5.95) than against Rival 1 (with an overall score of 7.70).", "answer": "Memorized"}

The discontinuation of the Fusion was said to be a part of Ford’s shifting strategic focus away from passenger cars toward crossovers and SUVs—many with electrified powertrains.1 Observers wondered if Ford could essentially abandon the market for automobiles as car sales had been its lifeblood since 1908 when Henry Ford revolutionized passenger trans￾portation with production of the Model T. Industry analysts also wondered if the American love affair with the SUV and trucks would continue if the price of gasoline began to escalate as the United States, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. engaged in tactics to alter energy prices around the world. Exhibit 1 below outlines key milestones in the history of the Ford Motor Company.\nFord’s Strategic Situation in 2020\nBy 2020, Ford employed over 200,000 people world￾wide in 70 plants producing midsize cars, SUVs,and pickup trucks. Since the recession of 2008, the company’s revenues had rebounded due to increased disposable income levels, falling unemployment, and arenewed demand for big-ticket purchases. However, thecompany reported falling sales in some of its establishedmarkets in 2019 and 2020—partially due to the spreadof the COVID-19 virus in early 2020.

By 2020, the company was moving toward manufac- turing “smart vehicles for a smart world.” The world plan focused on four pillars: (1) A winning portfolio; (2) new propulsion options; (3) a high-level autono- mous business built on the most trusted self-driving systems; and (4) cloud-based mobility experiences that deliver recurring revenue. The winning portfolio in 2020 was envisioned to be the Escape, Expedition, Explorer, Ranger, F-150 Hybrid, Bronco, and the Mustang Shelby GT500. The Ford Bronco was produced between 1966 and 1996 and was discontinued when the smaller two- door Bronco II suffered from a tipping problem. The reintroduced Bronco will be modular with a remov- able top and doors. Two years before the Bronco was discontin- ued, the automobile gained a great deal of atten- tion when Al Cowlings drove O.J.

No need more any comments.\n\nAs the events surrounding the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 made abundantly clear, there is a class of macro-level external factors that is not included as part of PESTEL analysis. This is the set of factors that occurs more irregularly and unpredictably, unlike the categories within PESTEL that can be expected to affect firms in an ongoing and more foreseeable manner. This additional set of factors can be thought of as societal shocks to the macro-environment; they include terrorism (whether by domestic or foreign agents), civil war, foreign invasion or occupation, and epidemics and pandemics. Societal shocks such as these also affect different indus- tries and companies to varying degrees, but they are much harder for companies to anticipate and prepare for since they often begin with little warning. The coordin- ated terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda against the United States now referred to as 9/11 (since they occurred on September 11, 2001) offer an example. These attacks had a significant economic impact, not only within the United States, but on world markets as well. New York City’s businesses suffered enormously , particularly those located.\nwithin and nearby the World Trade Center complex. Industries suffering an outsized effect include the airline industry, which had to cut back travel capacity by nearly 20%, and the export industry. Illustration Capsule 3.1 illustrates how another such societal shock—the coronavirus pandemic of 2020—affected industries, businesses, geogra phies, and countries differentially. \nAs company managers scan the external environment, they must be alert for poten- tially important outer-ring developments (whether in the form of societal shocks or among the components of PESTEL analysis), assess their impact and influence, and adapt the company’s direction and strategy as needed. However, the factors in a com- pany’s environment having the greatest strategy-shaping impact typically pertain to the company’s immediate industry and competitive environment.

No need more any comments.\nASSESSING THE COMPANY’S INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\nAfter gaining an understanding of the industry’s general economic characteristics, attention should be focused on the competitive dynamics of the industry. This entails using some well-validated concepts and analytic tools. These include the five forces framework, the value net, driving forces, strategic groups, competitor analysis, and key success factors. Proper use of these analytic tools can provide managers with the under- standing needed to craft a strategy that fits the company’s situation within their indus- try environment. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to describing how managers can use these tools to inform and improve their strategic choices.\nThe Five Forces Framework\nThe character and strength of the competitive forces operating in an industry are never the same from one industry to another. The most powerful and widely used tool for diagnosing the principal competitive pressures in a market is the five forces framework.1 This framework, depicted in Figure 3.3, holds that competitive pressures on compan- ies within an industry come from five sources. These include (1) competition from rival sellers, (2) competition from potential new entrants to the industry, (3) competition from producers of substitute products, (4) supplier bargaining power, and (5) customer bargaining power.\nUsing the five forces model to determine the nature and strength of competitive pressures in a given industry involves three steps: \n• Step 1: For each of the five forces, identify the different parties involved, along with the specific factors that bring about competitive pressures. \n• Step 2: Evaluate how strong the pressures stemming from each of the five forces are (strong, moderate, or weak). \n• Step 3: Determine whether the five forces, overall, are supportive of high industry profitability.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nThe Expected Reaction of Industry Members in Defending against New Entry \nA second factor affecting the threat of entry relates to the ability and willingness of indus- try incumbents to launch strong defensive maneuvers to maintain their positions and make it harder for a newcomer to compete successfully and profitably. Entry candidates may have second thoughts about attempting entry if they conclude that existing firms will mount well-funded campaigns to hamper (or even defeat) a newcomer’s attempt to gain a market foothold big enough to compete successfully. Such campaigns can include any of the “competitive weapons” listed in Table 3.2, such as ramping up advertising expenditures, offering special price discounts to the very customers a newcomer is seek- ing to attract, or adding attractive new product features (to match or beat the newcomer’s product offering). Such actions can raise a newcomer’s cost of entry along with the risk of failing, making the prospect of entry less appealing. The result is that even the expectation on the part of new entrants that industry incumbents will contest a newcomer’s entry may be enough to dissuade entry candidates from going forward. Microsoft can be counted on to fiercely defend the position that Windows enjoys in computer operating systems and that Microsoft Office has in office productivity software. This may well have contributed to Microsoft’s ability to continuously dominate this market space.\nHowever, there are occasions when industry incumbents have nothing in their com- petitive arsenal that is formidable enough to either discourage entry or put obstacles in a newcomer’s path that will defeat its strategic efforts to become a viable competitor. In the restaurant industry, for example, existing restaurants in a given geographic market have few actions they can take to discourage a new restaurant from opening or to block it from attracting enough patrons to be profitable. A fierce competitor like Nike was unable to prevent newcomer Under Armour from rapidly growing its sales and market share in sports apparel. Furthermore, there are occasions when industry incumbents can be expected to refrain from taking or initiating any actions specifically aimed at contesting a newcomer’s entry. In large industries, entry by small startup enterprises normally poses no immediate or direct competitive threat to industry incumbents and their entry is not likely to provoke defensive actions. For instance, a new online retailer with sales prospects of maybe $5 to $10 million annually can reasonably expect to escape competitive retaliation from much larger online retailers selling similar goods. The less that a newcomer’s entry will adversely impact the sales and profitability of industry incumbents, the more reasonable it is for potential entrants to expect industry incumbents to refrain from reacting defensively\nFigure 3.5 summarizes the factors that cause the overall competitive pressure from potential entrants to be strong or weak. An analysis of these factors can help managers determine whether the threat of entry into their industry is high or low, in general. But certain kinds of companies—those with sizable financial resources, proven competitive capabilities, and a respected brand name—may be able to hurdle an industry’s entry barriers even when they are high.4 For example, when Honda opted to enter the U.S. lawn-mower market in competition against Toro, Snapper, Craftsman, John Deere, and others, it was easily able to hurdle entry barriers that would have been formidable to other newcomers because it had long-standing exper- tise in gasoline engines and a reputation for quality and durability in automobiles that gave it instant credibility with homeowners. As a result, Honda had to spend relatively little on inducing dealers to handle the Honda lawn-mower line or attracting cus- tomers. Similarly, Samsung’s brand reputation in televisions, DVD players, and other electronics products gave it strong credibility in entering the market for smartphones— Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones are now a formidable rival of Apple’s iPhone.\nIt is also important to recognize that the barriers to entering an industry can become stronger or weaker over time. For example, once key patents preventing new entry in the market for functional 3-D printers expired, the way was open for new competition to enter this industry. On the other hand, new strategic actions by incumbent firms to increase advertising, strengthen distributor–dealer relations, step up R&D, or improve product quality can erect higher roadblocks to entry.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nCompetitive Pressures from the Sellers of Substitute Products\nCompanies in one industry are vulnerable to competitive pressure from the actions of companies in a closely adjoining industry whenever buyers view the products of the two industries as good substitutes. Substitutes do not include other brands within your industry; this type of pressure comes from outside the industry. Substitute products from outside the industry are those that can perform the same or similar functions for the consumer as products within your industry. For instance, the producers of eye- glasses and contact lenses face competitive pressures from the doctors who do correc- tive laser surgery. Similarly, the producers of sugar experience competitive pressures from the producers of sugar substitutes (high-fructose corn syrup, agave syrup, and artificial sweeteners). Internet providers of news-related information have put brutal competitive pressure on the publishers of newspapers. The makers of smartphones, by building ever better cameras into their cell phones, have cut deeply into the sales of producers of handheld digital cameras—most smartphone owners now use their phone to take pictures rather than carrying a digital camera for picture-taking purposes.\nAs depicted in Figure 3.6, three factors determine whether the competitive pressures from substitute products are strong or weak. Competitive pressures are stronger when \n1 . Good substitutes are readily available and attractively priced. The presence of readily available and attractively priced substitutes creates competitive pressure by placing a ceiling on the prices industry members can charge without risking sales erosion. This price ceiling, at the same time, puts a lid on the profits that industry members can earn unless they find ways to cut costs. \n2. Buyers view the substitutes as comparable or better in terms of quality, performance, and other relevant attributes. The availability of substitutes inevitably invites custom- ers to compare performance, features, ease of use, and other attributes besides price. The users of paper cartons constantly weigh the price-performance trade-offs with plastic containers and metal cans, for example. Movie enthusiasts are increas- ingly weighing whether to go to movie theaters to watch newly released movies or wait until they can watch the same movies streamed to their home TV by Netflix, Amazon Prime, cable providers, and other on-demand sources. \n3. The costs that buyers incur in switching to the substitutes are low. Low switching costs make it easier for the sellers of attractive substitutes to lure buyers to their offer- ings; high switching costs deter buyers from purchasing substitute products.\nSome signs that the competitive strength of substitute products is increasing include (1) whether the sales of substitutes are growing faster than the sales of the industry being analyzed, (2) whether the producers of substitutes are investing in added capacity, and (3) whether the producers of substitutes are earning progressively higher profits. But before assessing the competitive pressures coming from substitutes, com- pany managers must identify the substitutes, which is less easy than it sounds since it involves (1) determining where the industry boundaries lie and (2) figuring out which other products or services can address the same basic customer needs as those pro- duced by industry members. Deciding on the industry boundaries is necessary for determining which firms are direct rivals and which produce substitutes. This is a mat- ter of perspective—there are no hard-and-fast rules, other than to say that other brands of the same basic product constitute rival products and not substitutes. Ultimately, it’s simply the buyer who decides what can serve as a good substitute.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nFigure 3.8 summarizes the factors determining the strength of buyer power in an industry. The top of this chart lists the factors that increase buyers’ bargaining power, which we discuss next. Note that the first five factors are the mirror image of those determining the bargaining power of suppliers.\n\nBuyer bargaining power is stronger when \n• Buyer demand is weak in relation to the available supply. Weak or declining demand and the resulting excess supply create a “buyers’ market,” in which bargain-hunting buyers have leverage in pressing industry members for better deals and special treatment. Conversely, strong or rapidly growing market demand creates a “sellers’ market” characterized by tight supplies or shortages—conditions that put buyers in a weak position to wring concessions from industry members. \n• Industry goods are standardized or differentiation is weak. In such circumstances, buyers make their selections on the basis of price, which increases price competi- tion among vendors. \n• Buyers’ costs of switching to competing brands or substitutes are relatively low. Switching costs put a cap on how much industry producers can raise prices or reduce quality before they will lose the buyer’s business. \n• Buyers are large and few in number relative to the number of sellers. The larger the buyers, the more important their business is to the seller and the more sellers will be willing to grant concessions. \n• Buyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward into the business of sellers. Beer producers like Anheuser Busch InBev SA/NV (whose brands include Budweiser, Molson Coors, and Heineken) have partially integrated backward into metal-can manufacturing to gain bargaining power in obtaining the balance of their can requirements from otherwise powerful metal-can manufacturers.\n• Buyers are well informed about the product offerings of sellers (product features and quality, prices, buyer reviews) and the cost of production (an indicator of markup). The more information buyers have, the better bargaining position they are in. The mushrooming availability of product information on the Internet (and its ready access on smartphones) is giving added bargaining power to consumers, since they can use this to find or negotiate better deals. Apps such as ShopSavvy and BuyVia are now making comparison shopping even easier. \n• Buyers have discretion to delay their purchases or perhaps even not make a purchase at all. Consumers often have the option to delay purchases of durable goods (cars, major appliances), or decline to buy discretionary goods (massages, concert tick- ets) if they are not happy with the prices offered. Business customers may also be able to defer their purchases of certain items, such as plant equipment or mainten- ance services. This puts pressure on sellers to provide concessions to buyers so that the sellers can keep their sales numbers from dropping off.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Most consumers grow more price-sensitive as the price tag of an item becomes a bigger fraction of their spending budget. Similarly, busi- ness buyers besieged by weak sales, intense competition, and other factors squeezing their profit margins are price-sensitive. Price sensitivity also grows among businesses as the cost of an item becomes a bigger fraction of their cost structure. Rising prices of frequently purchased items heighten the price sensitivity of all types of buyers. On the other hand, the price sensitivity of all types of buyers decreases the more that the quality of the product matters.\nThe following factors increase buyer price sensitivity and result in greater competi- tive pressures on the industry as a result: \n• Buyer price sensitivity increases when buyers are earning low profits or have low income. Price is a critical factor in the purchase decisions of low-income consumers and companies that are barely scraping by. In such cases, their high price sensitiv- ity limits the ability of sellers to charge high prices. \n• Buyers are more price-sensitive if the product represents a large fraction of their total purchases. When a purchase eats up a large portion of a buyer’s budget or repre- sents a significant part of his or her cost structure, the buyer cares more about price than might otherwise be the case. \n• Buyers are more price-sensitive when the quality of the product is not uppermost in their considerations. Quality matters little when products are relatively undifferentiated, leading buyers to focus more on price. But when quality affects performance, or can reduce a business buyer’s other costs (by saving on labor, materials, etc.), price will matter less.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Is any of the competitive forces suf- ficiently powerful to undermine industry profitability? Can companies in this industry reasonably expect to earn decent profits in light of the prevailing competitive forces?\nThe most extreme case of a “competitively unattractive” industry occurs when all five forces are producing strong competitive pressures: Rivalry among sellers is vigor- ous, low entry barriers allow new rivals to gain a market foothold, competition from substitutes is intense, and both suppliers and buyers are able to exercise considerable leverage. Strong competitive pressures coming from all five directions drive indus- try profitability to unacceptably low levels, frequently producing losses for many industry members and forcing some out of business. But an industry can be competitively unattractive without all five competitive forces being strong. In fact, intense competitive pressures from just one of the five forces may suffice to destroy the conditions for good profitability and prompt some companies to exit the business.\nAs a rule, the strongest competitive forces determine the extent of the competitive pressure on industry profitability. Thus, in evaluating the strength of the five forces overall and their effect on industry profitability, managers should look to the strong- est forces. Having more than one strong force will not worsen the effect on industry profitability, but it does mean that the industry has multiple competitive challenges with which to cope. In that sense, an industry with three to five strong forces is even more “unattractive” as a place to compete. Especially intense competitive conditions due to multiple strong forces seem to be the norm in tire manufacturing, apparel, and commercial airlines, three industries where profit margins have historically been thin. In contrast, when the overall impact of the five competitive forces is moderate to weak, an industry is “attractive” in the sense that the average industry member can reasonably expect to earn good profits and a nice return on investment. The ideal competitive environment for earning superior profits is one in which both suppliers and customers have limited power, there are no good substitutes, high barriers block further entry, and rivalry among present sellers is muted. Weak competition is the best of all possible worlds for also-ran companies because even they can usually eke out a decent profit—if a company can’t make a decent profit when competition is weak, then its business outlook is indeed grim.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Effectively matching a company’s business strategy to prevailing competitive conditions has two aspects: \n1 . Pursuing avenues that shield the firm from as many of the different competitive pressures as possible. \n2. Initiating actions calculated to shift the competitive forces in the company’s favor by altering the underlying factors driving the five forces. \nBut making headway on these two fronts first requires identifying competitive pressures, gauging the relative strength of each of the five competitive forces, and gain- ing a deep enough understanding of the state of competition in the industry to know which strategy buttons to push.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nCOMPLEMENTORS AND THE VALUE NET\nNot all interactions among industry participants are necessarily competitive in nature. Some have the potential to be cooperative, as the value net framework demonstrates. Like the five forces framework, the value net includes an analysis of buyers, suppliers, and substitutors (see Figure 3.9). But it differs from the five forces framework in several important ways.\nFirst, the analysis focuses on the interactions of industry participants with a particular company. Thus, it places that firm in the center of the framework, as Figure 3.9 shows. Second, the category of “competitors” is defined to include not only the focal firm’s direct competitors or industry rivals but also the sellers of sub- stitute products and potential entrants. Third, the value net framework introduces a new category of industry participant that is not found in the five forces framework— that of “complementors.” Complementors are the producers of complementary prod- ucts, which are products that enhance the value of the focal firm’s products when they are used together. Some examples include snorkels and swim fins or shoes and shoelaces.\nThe inclusion of complementors draws particular attention to the fact that suc- cess in the marketplace need not come at the expense of other industry participants. Interactions among industry participants may be cooperative in nature rather than competitive. In the case of complementors, an increase in sales for them is likely to increase the sales of the focal firm as well. But the value net framework also encour- ages managers to consider other forms of cooperative interactions and realize that value is created jointly by all industry participants. For example, a company’s suc- cess in the marketplace depends on establishing a reliable supply chain for its inputs, which implies the need for cooperative relations with its suppliers. Often a firm works hand in hand with its suppliers to ensure a smoother, more efficient operation for both parties. Newell-Rubbermaid, and Procter & Gamble for example, work cooperatively as suppliers to companies such as Walmart, Target, and Kohl’s. Even direct rivals may work cooperatively if they participate in industry trade associations or engage in joint lobbying efforts. Value net analysis can help managers discover the potential to improve their position through cooperative as well as competitive interactions.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nINDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND THE FORCES DRIVING CHANGE\nWhile it is critical to understand the nature and intensity of competitive and coopera- tive forces in an industry, it is equally critical to understand that the intensity of these forces is fluid and subject to change. All industries are affected by new developments and ongoing trends that alter industry conditions, some more speedily than others. The popular hypothesis that industries go through a life cycle of takeoff, rapid growth, maturity, market saturation and slowing growth, followed by stagnation or decline is but one aspect of industry change—many other new developments and emerging trends cause industry change.5 Any strategies devised by management will therefore play out in a dynamic industry environment, so it’s imperative that managers consider the factors driving industry change and how they might affect the industry environment. Moreover, with early notice, managers may be able to influence the direction or scope of environmental change and improve the outlook.\nIndustry and competitive conditions change because forces are enticing or pres- suring certain industry participants (competitors, customers, suppliers, complemen- tors) to alter their actions in important ways. The most powerful of the change agents are called driving forces because they have the biggest influences in reshap- ing the industry landscape and altering competitive conditions. Some driving forces originate in the outer ring of the company’s macro-environment (see Figure 3.2), but most originate in the company’s more immediate industry and competitive environment.\nDriving-forces analysis has three steps: (1) identifying what the driving forces are; (2) assessing whether the drivers of change are, on the whole, acting to make the indus- try more or less attractive; and (3) determining what strategy changes are needed to prepare for the impact of the driving forces. All three steps merit further discussion.\n\nIdentifying the Forces Driving Industry Change\nMany developments can affect an industry powerfully enough to qualify as driving forces. Some drivers of change are unique and specific to a particular industry situa- tion, but most drivers of industry and competitive change fall into one of the following categories:\n• Changes in an industry’s long-term growth rate. Shifts in industry growth up or down have the potential to affect the balance between industry supply and buyer demand, entry and exit, and the character and strength of competition. Whether demand is growing or declining is one of the key factors influencing the intensity of rivalry in an industry, as explained earlier. But the strength of this effect will depend on how changes in the industry growth rate affect entry and exit in the industry. If entry barriers are low, then growth in demand will attract new entrants, increasing the number of industry rivals and changing the competitive landscape. \n• Increasing globalization. Globalization can be precipitated by such factors as the blossoming of consumer demand in developing countries, the availability of lower-cost foreign inputs, and the reduction of trade barriers, as has occurred recently in many parts of Latin America and Asia. Significant differences in labor costs among countries give manufacturers a strong incentive to locate plants for labor-intensive products in low-wage countries and use these plants to supply market demand across the world. Wages in China, India, Vietnam, Mexico, and Brazil, for example, are much lower than those in the United States, Germany, and Japan. The forces of globalization are sometimes such a strong driver that companies find it highly advantageous, if not necessary, to spread their oper- ating reach into more and more country markets. Globalization is very much a driver of industry change in such industries as energy, mobile phones, steel, social media, public accounting, commercial aircraft, electric power generation equipment, and pharmaceuticals. \n• Emerging new Internet capabilities and applications. Mushrooming use of high-speed Internet service and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) technology, growing acceptance of online shopping, and the exploding popularity of Internet applica- tions (“apps”) have been major drivers of change in industry after industry. The Internet has allowed online discount stock brokers, such as E\\*TRADE, and TD Ameritrade to mount a strong challenge against full-service firms such as Edward Jones and Merrill Lynch. The newspaper industry has yet to figure out a strategy for surviving the advent of online news.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) facilitated by organizations such as Coursera, edX, and Udacity are profoundly affecting higher education. The “Internet of things” will feature faster speeds, dazzling applications, and billions of connected gadgets performing an array of functions, thus driving further industry and competitive changes. But Internet-related impacts vary from industry to industry. The challenges are to assess precisely how emerging Internet developments are altering a particular industry’s landscape and to factor these impacts into the strategy-making equation.\n• Shifts in who buys the products and how the products are used. Shifts in buyer demo- graphics and the ways products are used can greatly alter competitive conditions. Longer life expectancies and growing percentages of relatively well-to-do retirees, for example, are driving demand growth in such industries as cosmetic surgery, assisted living residences, and vacation travel. The burgeoning popularity of streaming video has affected broadband providers, wireless phone carriers, and television broadcasters, and created opportunities for such new entertainment businesses as Hulu and Netflix. \n• Technological change and manufacturing process innovation. Advances in technology can cause disruptive change in an industry by introducing substitutes or can alter the industry landscape by opening up whole new industry frontiers. For instance, revolutionary change in autonomous system technology has put Google, Tesla, Apple, and every major automobile manufacturer into a race to develop viable self- driving vehicles. \n• Product innovation. An ongoing stream of product innovations tends to alter the pattern of competition in an industry by attracting more first-time buyers, rejuve- nating industry growth, and/or increasing product differentiation, with concomi- tant effects on rivalry, entry threat, and buyer power. Product innovation has been a key driving force in the smartphone industry, which in an ever more connected world is driving change in other industries. Philips Lighting Hue bulbs now allow homeowners to use a smartphone app to remotely turn lights on and off, blink if an intruder is detected, and create a wide range of white and color ambiances. Wearable action-capture cameras and unmanned aerial view drones are rapidly becoming a disruptive force in the digital camera industry by enabling photography shots and videos not feasible with handheld digital cameras.\n• Marketing innovation. When firms are successful in introducing new ways to market their products, they can spark a burst of buyer interest, widen industry demand, increase product differentiation, and lower unit costs—any or all of which can alter the competitive positions of rival firms and force strategy revisions. Consider, for example, the growing propensity of advertisers to place a bigger percentage of their ads on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nThis produces a two-dimensional diagram like the one for the U.S. pizza chain industry in Illustration Capsule 3.2.\nSeveral guidelines need to be observed in creating strategic group maps. First, the two variables selected as axes for the map should not be highly correlated; if they are, the circles on the map will fall along a diagonal and reveal nothing more about the relative positions of competitors than would be revealed by comparing the rivals on just one of the variables. For instance, if companies with broad product lines use mul- tiple distribution channels while companies with narrow lines use a single distribution channel, then looking at the differences in distribution-channel approaches adds no new information about positioning.\nSecond, the variables chosen as axes for the map should reflect important differences among rival approaches—when rivals differ on both variables, the locations of the rivals will be scattered, thus showing how they are positioned differently. Third, the variables used as axes don’t have to be either quantitative or continuous; rather, they can be discrete variables, defined in terms of distinct classes and combinations. Fourth, drawing the sizes of the circles on the map proportional to the combined sales of the firms in each strategic group allows the map to reflect the relative sizes of each strategic group. Fifth, if more than two good variables can be used as axes for the map, then it is wise to draw several maps to give different exposures to the competitive positioning relationships present in the industry’s structure—there is not necessarily one best map for portraying how competing firms are positioned.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nThe Value of Strategic Group Maps\nStrategic group maps are revealing in several respects. The most important has to do with identifying which industry members are close rivals and which are distant rivals. Firms in the same strategic group are the closest rivals; the next closest rivals are in the immediately adjacent groups. Often, firms in strategic groups that are far apart on the map hardly compete at all. For instance, Walmart’s clientele, merchandise selection, and pricing points are much too different to justify calling Walmart a close competitor of Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue. For the same reason, the beers produced by Yuengling are really not in competition with the beers produced by Pabst. The second thing to be gleaned from strategic group mapping is that not all pos- itions on the map are equally attractive.7 Two reasons account for why some positions can be more attractive than others:\n1 . Prevailing competitive pressures from the industry’s five forces may cause the profit potential of different strategic groups to vary. The profit prospects of firms in different strategic groups can vary from good to poor because of differing degrees of com- petitive rivalry within strategic groups, differing pressures from potential entrants to each group, differing degrees of exposure to competition from substitute prod- ucts outside the industry, and differing degrees of supplier or customer bargaining power from group to group. For instance, in the ready-to-eat cereal industry, there are significantly higher entry barriers (capital requirements, brand loyalty , etc.) for the strategic group comprising the large branded-cereal makers than for the group of generic-cereal makers or the group of small natural-cereal producers. Differences among the branded rivals versus the generic cereal makers make rivalry stronger within the generic-cereal strategic group. Among apparel retailers, the competi- tive battle between Marshall’s and TJ MAXX is more intense (with consequently smaller profit margins) than the rivalry among Prada, Burberry, Gucci, Armani, and other high-end fashion retailers.\n2. Industry driving forces may favor some strategic groups and hurt others. Likewise, industry driving forces can boost the business outlook for some strategic groups and adversely impact the business prospects of others. In the energy industry, produ- cers of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, are gaining ground over fossil fuel-based producers due to improvements in technology and increased concern over climate change. Firms in strategic groups that are being adversely impacted by driving forces may try to shift to a more favorably situated position. If certain firms are known to be trying to change their competitive positions on the map, then attaching arrows to the circles showing the targeted direction helps clarify the picture of competitive maneuvering among rivals.\nThus, part of strategic group map analysis always entails drawing conclusions about where on the map is the “best” place to be and why. Which companies/strategic groups are destined to prosper because of their positions? Which companies/strate- gic groups seem destined to struggle? What accounts for why some parts of the map are better than others? Since some strategic groups are more attractive than others, one might ask why less well-positioned firms do not simply migrate to the more attrac- tive position. The answer is that mobility barriers restrict movement between groups in the same way that entry barriers prevent easy entry into attractive industries. The most profitable strategic groups may be protected from entry by high mobility barriers.", "answer": "Memorized."}

As in sports, scouting the opposition is an essential part of game plan development. Gathering competitive intelligence about the strategic direction and likely moves of key competitors allows a company to prepare defensive coun- termoves, to craft its own strategic moves with some confidence about what market maneuvers to expect from rivals in response, and to exploit any openings that arise from competitors’ missteps. The question is where to look for such information, since rivals rarely reveal their strategic intentions openly. If information is not dir- ectly available, what are the best indicators?\nMichael Porter’s SOAR Framework for Competitor Analysis points to four indica- tors of a rival’s likely strategic moves and countermoves. These include a rival’s Strategy, Objectives, Assumptions about itself and the industry, and Resources and capabilities, as shown in Figure 3.10. A strategic profile of a competitor that provides good clues to its behavioral proclivities can be constructed by characterizing the rival along these four dimensions. By “behavioral proclivities,” we mean what competitive moves a rival is likely to make and how they are likely to react to the competitive moves of your company—its probable actions and reactions. By listing all that you know about a competitor (or a set of competitors) with respect to each of the four elements of the SOAR framework, you are likely to gain some insight about how the rival will behave in the near term. And know- ledge of this sort can help you to predict how this will affect you, and how you should position yourself to respond. That is, what should you do to protect yourself or gain advan- tage now (in advance); and what should you do in response to your rivals next moves?", "answer": "Memorized."}

Entry candidates may have second thoughts about attempting entry if they conclude that existing firms will mount well-funded campaigns to hamper (or even defeat) a newcomer’s attempt to gain a market foothold big enough to compete successfully. Such campaigns can include any of the “competitive weapons” listed in Table 3.2, such as ramping up advertising expenditures, offering special price discounts to the very customers a newcomer is seek- ing to attract, or adding attractive new product features (to match or beat the newcomer’s product offering). Such actions can raise a newcomer’s cost of entry along with the risk of failing, making the prospect of entry less appealing. The result is that even the expectation on the part of new entrants that industry incumbents will contest a newcomer’s entry may be enough to dissuade entry candidates from going forward. Microsoft can be counted on to fiercely defend the position that Windows enjoys in computer operating systems and that Microsoft Office has in office productivity software. This may well have contributed to Microsoft’s ability to continuously dominate this market space.\nHowever, there are occasions when industry incumbents have nothing in their com- petitive arsenal that is formidable enough to either discourage entry or put obstacles in a newcomer’s path that will defeat its strategic efforts to become a viable competitor. In the restaurant industry, for example, existing restaurants in a given geographic market have few actions they can take to discourage a new restaurant from opening or to block it from attracting enough patrons to be profitable. A fierce competitor like Nike was unable to prevent newcomer Under Armour from rapidly growing its sales and market share in sports apparel. Furthermore, there are occasions when industry incumbents can be expected to refrain from taking or initiating any actions specifically aimed at contesting a newcomer’s entry. In large industries, entry by small startup enterprises normally poses no immediate or direct competitive threat to industry incumbents and their entry is not likely to provoke defensive actions. For instance, a new online retailer with sales prospects of maybe $5 to $10 million annually can reasonably expect to escape competitive retaliation from much larger online retailers selling similar goods. The less that a newcomer’s entry will adversely impact the sales and profitability of industry incumbents, the more reasonable it is for potential entrants to expect industry incumbents to refrain from reacting defensively\nFigure 3.5 summarizes the factors that cause the overall competitive pressure from potential entrants to be strong or weak. An analysis of these factors can help managers determine whether the threat of entry into their industry is high or low, in general. But certain kinds of companies—those with sizable financial resources, proven competitive capabilities, and a respected brand name—may be able to hurdle an industry’s entry barriers even when they are high.4 For example, when Honda opted to enter the U.S. lawn-mower market in competition against Toro, Snapper, Craftsman, John Deere, and others, it was easily able to hurdle entry barriers that would have been formidable to other newcomers because it had long-standing exper- tise in gasoline engines and a reputation for quality and durability in automobiles that gave it instant credibility with homeowners. As a result, Honda had to spend relatively little on inducing dealers to handle the Honda lawn-mower line or attracting cus- tomers. Similarly, Samsung’s brand reputation in televisions, DVD players, and other electronics products gave it strong credibility in entering the market for smartphones— Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones are now a formidable rival of Apple’s iPhone.\nIt is also important to recognize that the barriers to entering an industry can become stronger or weaker over time. For example, once key patents preventing new entry in the market for functional 3-D printers expired, the way was open for new competition to enter this industry. On the other hand, new strategic actions by incumbent firms to increase advertising, strengthen distributor–dealer relations, step up R&D, or improve product quality can erect higher roadblocks to entry.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nCompetitive Pressures from the Sellers of Substitute Products\nCompanies in one industry are vulnerable to competitive pressure from the actions of companies in a closely adjoining industry whenever buyers view the products of the two industries as good substitutes. Substitutes do not include other brands within your industry; this type of pressure comes from outside the industry. Substitute products from outside the industry are those that can perform the same or similar functions for the consumer as products within your industry. For instance, the producers of eye- glasses and contact lenses face competitive pressures from the doctors who do correc- tive laser surgery. Similarly, the producers of sugar experience competitive pressures from the producers of sugar substitutes (high-fructose corn syrup, agave syrup, and artificial sweeteners). Internet providers of news-related information have put brutal competitive pressure on the publishers of newspapers. The makers of smartphones, by building ever better cameras into their cell phones, have cut deeply into the sales of producers of handheld digital cameras—most smartphone owners now use their phone to take pictures rather than carrying a digital camera for picture-taking purposes.\nAs depicted in Figure 3.6, three factors determine whether the competitive pressures from substitute products are strong or weak. Competitive pressures are stronger when \n1 . Good substitutes are readily available and attractively priced. The presence of readily available and attractively priced substitutes creates competitive pressure by placing a ceiling on the prices industry members can charge without risking sales erosion. This price ceiling, at the same time, puts a lid on the profits that industry members can earn unless they find ways to cut costs. \n2. Buyers view the substitutes as comparable or better in terms of quality, performance, and other relevant attributes. The availability of substitutes inevitably invites custom- ers to compare performance, features, ease of use, and other attributes besides price. The users of paper cartons constantly weigh the price-performance trade-offs with plastic containers and metal cans, for example. Movie enthusiasts are increas- ingly weighing whether to go to movie theaters to watch newly released movies or wait until they can watch the same movies streamed to their home TV by Netflix, Amazon Prime, cable providers, and other on-demand sources. \n3. The costs that buyers incur in switching to the substitutes are low. Low switching costs make it easier for the sellers of attractive substitutes to lure buyers to their offer- ings; high switching costs deter buyers from purchasing substitute products.\nSome signs that the competitive strength of substitute products is increasing include (1) whether the sales of substitutes are growing faster than the sales of the industry being analyzed, (2) whether the producers of substitutes are investing in added capacity, and (3) whether the producers of substitutes are earning progressively higher profits. But before assessing the competitive pressures coming from substitutes, com- pany managers must identify the substitutes, which is less easy than it sounds since it involves (1) determining where the industry boundaries lie and (2) figuring out which other products or services can address the same basic customer needs as those pro- duced by industry members. Deciding on the industry boundaries is necessary for determining which firms are direct rivals and which produce substitutes. This is a mat- ter of perspective—there are no hard-and-fast rules, other than to say that other brands of the same basic product constitute rival products and not substitutes. Ultimately, it’s simply the buyer who decides what can serve as a good substitute.", "answer": "Memorized."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "Strategic Management Chapter 3.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\nBuyer bargaining power is stronger when \n• Buyer demand is weak in relation to the available supply. Weak or declining demand and the resulting excess supply create a “buyers’ market,” in which bargain-hunting buyers have leverage in pressing industry members for better deals and special treatment. Conversely, strong or rapidly growing market demand creates a “sellers’ market” characterized by tight supplies or shortages—conditions that put buyers in a weak position to wring concessions from industry members. \n• Industry goods are standardized or differentiation is weak. In such circumstances, buyers make their selections on the basis of price, which increases price competi- tion among vendors. \n• Buyers’ costs of switching to competing brands or substitutes are relatively low. Switching costs put a cap on how much industry producers can raise prices or reduce quality before they will lose the buyer’s business. \n• Buyers are large and few in number relative to the number of sellers. The larger the buyers, the more important their business is to the seller and the more sellers will be willing to grant concessions. \n• Buyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward into the business of sellers. Beer producers like Anheuser Busch InBev SA/NV (whose brands include Budweiser, Molson Coors, and Heineken) have partially integrated backward into metal-can manufacturing to gain bargaining power in obtaining the balance of their can requirements from otherwise powerful metal-can manufacturers.\n• Buyers are well informed about the product offerings of sellers (product features and quality, prices, buyer reviews) and the cost of production (an indicator of markup). The more information buyers have, the better bargaining position they are in. The mushrooming availability of product information on the Internet (and its ready access on smartphones) is giving added bargaining power to consumers, since they can use this to find or negotiate better deals. Apps such as ShopSavvy and BuyVia are now making comparison shopping even easier. \n• Buyers have discretion to delay their purchases or perhaps even not make a purchase at all. Consumers often have the option to delay purchases of durable goods (cars, major appliances), or decline to buy discretionary goods (massages, concert tick- ets) if they are not happy with the prices offered. Business customers may also be able to defer their purchases of certain items, such as plant equipment or mainten- ance services. This puts pressure on sellers to provide concessions to buyers so that the sellers can keep their sales numbers from dropping off.\nWhether Buyers Are More or Less Price-Sensitive Low-income and budget- constrained consumers are almost always price-sensitive; bargain-hunting consumers are highly price-sensitive by nature. Most consumers grow more price-sensitive as the price tag of an item becomes a bigger fraction of their spending budget. Similarly, busi- ness buyers besieged by weak sales, intense competition, and other factors squeezing their profit margins are price-sensitive. Price sensitivity also grows among businesses as the cost of an item becomes a bigger fraction of their cost structure. Rising prices of frequently purchased items heighten the price sensitivity of all types of buyers. On the other hand, the price sensitivity of all types of buyers decreases the more that the quality of the product matters.", "answer": "Memorized."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "Strategic Management Chapter 3.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\nThe following factors increase buyer price sensitivity and result in greater competi- tive pressures on the industry as a result: \n• Buyer price sensitivity increases when buyers are earning low profits or have low income. Price is a critical factor in the purchase decisions of low-income consumers and companies that are barely scraping by. In such cases, their high price sensitiv- ity limits the ability of sellers to charge high prices. \n• Buyers are more price-sensitive if the product represents a large fraction of their total purchases. When a purchase eats up a large portion of a buyer’s budget or repre- sents a significant part of his or her cost structure, the buyer cares more about price than might otherwise be the case. \n• Buyers are more price-sensitive when the quality of the product is not uppermost in their considerations. Quality matters little when products are relatively undifferentiated, leading buyers to focus more on price. But when quality affects performance, or can reduce a business buyer’s other costs (by saving on labor, materials, etc.), price will matter less.\nIs the Collective Strength of the Five Competitive Forces Conducive to Good Profitability?\nAssessing whether each of the five competitive forces gives rise to strong, moderate, or weak competitive pressures sets the stage for evaluating whether, overall, the strength of the five forces is conducive to good profitability. Is any of the competitive forces suf- ficiently powerful to undermine industry profitability? Can companies in this industry reasonably expect to earn decent profits in light of the prevailing competitive forces?\nThe most extreme case of a “competitively unattractive” industry occurs when all five forces are producing strong competitive pressures: Rivalry among sellers is vigor- ous, low entry barriers allow new rivals to gain a market foothold, competition from substitutes is intense, and both suppliers and buyers are able to exercise considerable leverage. Strong competitive pressures coming from all five directions drive indus- try profitability to unacceptably low levels, frequently producing losses for many industry members and forcing some out of business. But an industry can be competitively unattractive without all five competitive forces being strong. In fact, intense competitive pressures from just one of the five forces may suffice to destroy the conditions for good profitability and prompt some companies to exit the business.\nAs a rule, the strongest competitive forces determine the extent of the competitive pressure on industry profitability. Thus, in evaluating the strength of the five forces overall and their effect on industry profitability, managers should look to the strong- est forces. Having more than one strong force will not worsen the effect on industry profitability, but it does mean that the industry has multiple competitive challenges with which to cope. In that sense, an industry with three to five strong forces is even more “unattractive” as a place to compete. Especially intense competitive conditions due to multiple strong forces seem to be the norm in tire manufacturing, apparel, and commercial airlines, three industries where profit margins have historically been thin. In contrast, when the overall impact of the five competitive forces is moderate to weak, an industry is “attractive” in the sense that the average industry member can reasonably expect to earn good profits and a nice return on investment. The ideal competitive environment for earning superior profits is one in which both suppliers and customers have limited power, there are no good substitutes, high barriers block further entry, and rivalry among present sellers is muted. Weak competition is the best of all possible worlds for also-ran companies because even they can usually eke out a decent profit—if a company can’t make a decent profit when competition is weak, then its business outlook is indeed grim.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Effectively matching a company’s business strategy to prevailing competitive conditions has two aspects: \n1 . Pursuing avenues that shield the firm from as many of the different competitive pressures as possible. \n2. Initiating actions calculated to shift the competitive forces in the company’s favor by altering the underlying factors driving the five forces. \nBut making headway on these two fronts first requires identifying competitive pressures, gauging the relative strength of each of the five competitive forces, and gain- ing a deep enough understanding of the state of competition in the industry to know which strategy buttons to push.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nCOMPLEMENTORS AND THE VALUE NET\nNot all interactions among industry participants are necessarily competitive in nature. Some have the potential to be cooperative, as the value net framework demonstrates. Like the five forces framework, the value net includes an analysis of buyers, suppliers, and substitutors (see Figure 3.9). But it differs from the five forces framework in several important ways.\nFirst, the analysis focuses on the interactions of industry participants with a particular company. Thus, it places that firm in the center of the framework, as Figure 3.9 shows. Second, the category of “competitors” is defined to include not only the focal firm’s direct competitors or industry rivals but also the sellers of sub- stitute products and potential entrants. Third, the value net framework introduces a new category of industry participant that is not found in the five forces framework— that of “complementors.” Complementors are the producers of complementary prod- ucts, which are products that enhance the value of the focal firm’s products when they are used together. Some examples include snorkels and swim fins or shoes and shoelaces.\nThe inclusion of complementors draws particular attention to the fact that suc- cess in the marketplace need not come at the expense of other industry participants. Interactions among industry participants may be cooperative in nature rather than competitive. In the case of complementors, an increase in sales for them is likely to increase the sales of the focal firm as well. But the value net framework also encour- ages managers to consider other forms of cooperative interactions and realize that value is created jointly by all industry participants. For example, a company’s suc- cess in the marketplace depends on establishing a reliable supply chain for its inputs, which implies the need for cooperative relations with its suppliers. Often a firm works hand in hand with its suppliers to ensure a smoother, more efficient operation for both parties. Newell-Rubbermaid, and Procter & Gamble for example, work cooperatively as suppliers to companies such as Walmart, Target, and Kohl’s. Even direct rivals may work cooperatively if they participate in industry trade associations or engage in joint lobbying efforts. Value net analysis can help managers discover the potential to improve their position through cooperative as well as competitive interactions.", "answer": "Memorized."}

All industries are affected by new developments and ongoing trends that alter industry conditions, some more speedily than others. The popular hypothesis that industries go through a life cycle of takeoff, rapid growth, maturity, market saturation and slowing growth, followed by stagnation or decline is but one aspect of industry change—many other new developments and emerging trends cause industry change.5 Any strategies devised by management will therefore play out in a dynamic industry environment, so it’s imperative that managers consider the factors driving industry change and how they might affect the industry environment. Moreover, with early notice, managers may be able to influence the direction or scope of environmental change and improve the outlook.\nIndustry and competitive conditions change because forces are enticing or pres- suring certain industry participants (competitors, customers, suppliers, complemen- tors) to alter their actions in important ways. The most powerful of the change agents are called driving forces because they have the biggest influences in reshap- ing the industry landscape and altering competitive conditions. Some driving forces originate in the outer ring of the company’s macro-environment (see Figure 3.2), but most originate in the company’s more immediate industry and competitive environment.\nDriving-forces analysis has three steps: (1) identifying what the driving forces are; (2) assessing whether the drivers of change are, on the whole, acting to make the indus- try more or less attractive; and (3) determining what strategy changes are needed to prepare for the impact of the driving forces. All three steps merit further discussion.\n\nIdentifying the Forces Driving Industry Change\nMany developments can affect an industry powerfully enough to qualify as driving forces. Some drivers of change are unique and specific to a particular industry situa- tion, but most drivers of industry and competitive change fall into one of the following categories:\n• Changes in an industry’s long-term growth rate. Shifts in industry growth up or down have the potential to affect the balance between industry supply and buyer demand, entry and exit, and the character and strength of competition. Whether demand is growing or declining is one of the key factors influencing the intensity of rivalry in an industry, as explained earlier. But the strength of this effect will depend on how changes in the industry growth rate affect entry and exit in the industry. If entry barriers are low, then growth in demand will attract new entrants, increasing the number of industry rivals and changing the competitive landscape. \n• Increasing globalization. Globalization can be precipitated by such factors as the blossoming of consumer demand in developing countries, the availability of lower-cost foreign inputs, and the reduction of trade barriers, as has occurred recently in many parts of Latin America and Asia. Significant differences in labor costs among countries give manufacturers a strong incentive to locate plants for labor-intensive products in low-wage countries and use these plants to supply market demand across the world. Wages in China, India, Vietnam, Mexico, and Brazil, for example, are much lower than those in the United States, Germany, and Japan. The forces of globalization are sometimes such a strong driver that companies find it highly advantageous, if not necessary, to spread their oper- ating reach into more and more country markets. Globalization is very much a driver of industry change in such industries as energy, mobile phones, steel, social media, public accounting, commercial aircraft, electric power generation equipment, and pharmaceuticals. \n• Emerging new Internet capabilities and applications. Mushrooming use of high-speed Internet service and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) technology, growing acceptance of online shopping, and the exploding popularity of Internet applica- tions (“apps”) have been major drivers of change in industry after industry. The Internet has allowed online discount stock brokers, such as E\\*TRADE, and TD Ameritrade to mount a strong challenge against full-service firms such as Edward Jones and Merrill Lynch. The newspaper industry has yet to figure out a strategy for surviving the advent of online news.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) facilitated by organizations such as Coursera, edX, and Udacity are profoundly affecting higher education. The “Internet of things” will feature faster speeds, dazzling applications, and billions of connected gadgets performing an array of functions, thus driving further industry and competitive changes. But Internet-related impacts vary from industry to industry. The challenges are to assess precisely how emerging Internet developments are altering a particular industry’s landscape and to factor these impacts into the strategy-making equation.\n• Shifts in who buys the products and how the products are used. Shifts in buyer demo- graphics and the ways products are used can greatly alter competitive conditions. Longer life expectancies and growing percentages of relatively well-to-do retirees, for example, are driving demand growth in such industries as cosmetic surgery, assisted living residences, and vacation travel. The burgeoning popularity of streaming video has affected broadband providers, wireless phone carriers, and television broadcasters, and created opportunities for such new entertainment businesses as Hulu and Netflix. \n• Technological change and manufacturing process innovation. Advances in technology can cause disruptive change in an industry by introducing substitutes or can alter the industry landscape by opening up whole new industry frontiers. For instance, revolutionary change in autonomous system technology has put Google, Tesla, Apple, and every major automobile manufacturer into a race to develop viable self- driving vehicles. \n• Product innovation. An ongoing stream of product innovations tends to alter the pattern of competition in an industry by attracting more first-time buyers, rejuve- nating industry growth, and/or increasing product differentiation, with concomi- tant effects on rivalry, entry threat, and buyer power. Product innovation has been a key driving force in the smartphone industry, which in an ever more connected world is driving change in other industries. Philips Lighting Hue bulbs now allow homeowners to use a smartphone app to remotely turn lights on and off, blink if an intruder is detected, and create a wide range of white and color ambiances. Wearable action-capture cameras and unmanned aerial view drones are rapidly becoming a disruptive force in the digital camera industry by enabling photography shots and videos not feasible with handheld digital cameras.\n• Marketing innovation. When firms are successful in introducing new ways to market their products, they can spark a burst of buyer interest, widen industry demand, increase product differentiation, and lower unit costs—any or all of which can alter the competitive positions of rival firms and force strategy revisions. Consider, for example, the growing propensity of advertisers to place a bigger percentage of their ads on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nThis produces a two-dimensional diagram like the one for the U.S. pizza chain industry in Illustration Capsule 3.2.\nSeveral guidelines need to be observed in creating strategic group maps. First, the two variables selected as axes for the map should not be highly correlated; if they are, the circles on the map will fall along a diagonal and reveal nothing more about the relative positions of competitors than would be revealed by comparing the rivals on just one of the variables. For instance, if companies with broad product lines use mul- tiple distribution channels while companies with narrow lines use a single distribution channel, then looking at the differences in distribution-channel approaches adds no new information about positioning.\nSecond, the variables chosen as axes for the map should reflect important differences among rival approaches—when rivals differ on both variables, the locations of the rivals will be scattered, thus showing how they are positioned differently. Third, the variables used as axes don’t have to be either quantitative or continuous; rather, they can be discrete variables, defined in terms of distinct classes and combinations. Fourth, drawing the sizes of the circles on the map proportional to the combined sales of the firms in each strategic group allows the map to reflect the relative sizes of each strategic group. Fifth, if more than two good variables can be used as axes for the map, then it is wise to draw several maps to give different exposures to the competitive positioning relationships present in the industry’s structure—there is not necessarily one best map for portraying how competing firms are positioned.", "answer": "Memorized."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "Strategic Management Chapter 3.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\nThe Value of Strategic Group Maps\nStrategic group maps are revealing in several respects. The most important has to do with identifying which industry members are close rivals and which are distant rivals. Firms in the same strategic group are the closest rivals; the next closest rivals are in the immediately adjacent groups. Often, firms in strategic groups that are far apart on the map hardly compete at all. For instance, Walmart’s clientele, merchandise selection, and pricing points are much too different to justify calling Walmart a close competitor of Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue. For the same reason, the beers produced by Yuengling are really not in competition with the beers produced by Pabst. The second thing to be gleaned from strategic group mapping is that not all pos- itions on the map are equally attractive.7 Two reasons account for why some positions can be more attractive than others:\n1 . Prevailing competitive pressures from the industry’s five forces may cause the profit potential of different strategic groups to vary. The profit prospects of firms in different strategic groups can vary from good to poor because of differing degrees of com- petitive rivalry within strategic groups, differing pressures from potential entrants to each group, differing degrees of exposure to competition from substitute prod- ucts outside the industry, and differing degrees of supplier or customer bargaining power from group to group. For instance, in the ready-to-eat cereal industry, there are significantly higher entry barriers (capital requirements, brand loyalty , etc.) for the strategic group comprising the large branded-cereal makers than for the group of generic-cereal makers or the group of small natural-cereal producers. Differences among the branded rivals versus the generic cereal makers make rivalry stronger within the generic-cereal strategic group. Among apparel retailers, the competi- tive battle between Marshall’s and TJ MAXX is more intense (with consequently smaller profit margins) than the rivalry among Prada, Burberry, Gucci, Armani, and other high-end fashion retailers.\n2. Industry driving forces may favor some strategic groups and hurt others. Likewise, industry driving forces can boost the business outlook for some strategic groups and adversely impact the business prospects of others. In the energy industry, produ- cers of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, are gaining ground over fossil fuel-based producers due to improvements in technology and increased concern over climate change. Firms in strategic groups that are being adversely impacted by driving forces may try to shift to a more favorably situated position. If certain firms are known to be trying to change their competitive positions on the map, then attaching arrows to the circles showing the targeted direction helps clarify the picture of competitive maneuvering among rivals.\nThus, part of strategic group map analysis always entails drawing conclusions about where on the map is the “best” place to be and why. Which companies/strategic groups are destined to prosper because of their positions? Which companies/strate- gic groups seem destined to struggle? What accounts for why some parts of the map are better than others? Since some strategic groups are more attractive than others, one might ask why less well-positioned firms do not simply migrate to the more attrac- tive position. The answer is that mobility barriers restrict movement between groups in the same way that entry barriers prevent easy entry into attractive industries. The most profitable strategic groups may be protected from entry by high mobility barriers.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Putting them all together provides an even richer and more nuanced picture. Thus , the final step in evaluating the industry and competitive environment is to use the results of each of the analyses performed to determine whether the industry presents the company with strong prospects for competitive success and attractive profits. The important factors on which to base a conclusion include \n• How the company is being impacted by the state of the macro-environment. \n• Whether strong competitive forces are squeezing industry profitability to subpar levels. \n• Whether the presence of complementors and the possibility of cooperative actions improve the company’s prospects. \n• Whether industry profitability will be favorably or unfavorably affected by the pre- vailing driving forces. \n• Whether the company occupies a stronger market position than rivals. \n• Whether this is likely to change in the course of competitive interactions. \n• How well the company’s strategy delivers on the industry key success factors.\nAs a general proposition, the anticipated industry environment is fundamentally attract- ive if it presents a company with good opportunity for above-average profitability; the industry outlook is fundamentally unattractive if a company’s profit prospects are unappealingly low.\nHowever, it is a mistake to think of a particular industry as being equally attractive or unattractive to all industry participants and all potential entrants. Attractiveness is relative, not absolute, and conclusions one way or the other have to be drawn from the perspective of a particular company. For instance, a favor- ably positioned competitor may see ample opportunity to capitalize on the vulner- abilities of weaker rivals even though industry conditions are otherwise somewhat dismal. At the same time, industries attractive to insiders may be unattractive to outsiders because of the difficulty of challenging current market leaders or because they have more attractive opportunities elsewhere.\nWhen a company decides an industry is fundamentally attractive and presents good opportunities, a strong case can be made that it should invest aggressively to cap- ture the opportunities it sees and to improve its long-term competitive position in the business. When a strong competitor concludes an industry is becoming less attractive, it may elect to simply protect its present position, investing cautiously—if at all—and looking for opportunities in other industries. A competitively weak company in an unattractive industry may see its best option as finding a buyer, perhaps a rival, to acquire its business", "answer": "Memorized."}

The objective of a well-crafted strategy is not merely temporary competitive success and profits in the short run, but rather the sort of lasting success that can support growth and secure the company’s future over the long term. Achieving this entails making a managerial commitment to a coherent array of well-considered choices about how to compete.2 These include\n• How to position the company in the marketplace.\n• How to attract customers.\n• How to compete against rivals.\n• How to achieve the company’s performance targets.\n• How to capitalize on opportunities to grow the business.\n• How to respond to changing economic and market conditions.\nIn most industries, companies have considerable freedom in choosing the hows of strategy.3 Some companies strive to achieve lower costs than rivals, while others aim for product superiority or more personalized customer service dimensions that rivals cannot match. Some companies opt for wide product lines, while others concentrate their energies on a narrow product lineup. Some deliberately confine their operations to local or regional markets; others opt to compete nationally, internationally (several countries), or globally (all or most of the major country markets worldwide). Choices of how best to compete against rivals have to be made in light of the firm’s resources and capabilities and in light of the competitive approaches rival companies are employing.\nStrategy Is about Competing Differently\nMimicking the strategies of successful industry rivals—with either copycat product\nofferings or maneuvers to stake out the same market position—rarely works. Rather, every company’s strategy needs to have some distinctive element that draws in cus- tomers and provides a competitive edge. Strategy, at its essence, is about competing differently—doing what rival firms don’t do or what rival firms can’t do.4 This does not mean that the key elements of a company’s strategy have to be 100 percent different, but rather that they must differ in at least some important respects. A strategy stands a better chance of succeeding when it is predicated on actions, business approaches, and competitive moves aimed at (1) appealing to buyers in ways that set a company apart from its rivals and (2) staking out a market position that is not crowded with strong competitors.\nA company’s strategy provides direction and guidance, in terms of not only what the company should do but also what it should not do. Knowing what not to do can be as important as knowing what to do, strategically. At best, making the wrong strategic moves will prove a distraction and a waste of company resources. At worst, it can bring about unintended long-term consequences that put the com- pany’s very survival at risk.", "answer": "Memorized."}

A company has a competitive advantage whenever it has some type of edge over rivals in attracting buyers and cop- ing with competitive forces. A competitive advantage is essential for realizing greater marketplace success and higher profitability over the long term.\nThere are many routes to competitive advantage, but they all involve one of two basic mechanisms. Either they provide the customer with a product or service that the customer values more highly than others (higher perceived value), or they produce their product or service more efficiently (lower costs). Delivering superior value or delivering value more efficiently—whatever form it takes—nearly always requires per- forming value chain activities differently than rivals and building capabilities that are not readily matched. In Illustration Capsule 1.1, it is evident that Apple, Inc. has gained a competitive advantage over its rivals in the technological device industry through its efforts to create “must-have,” exciting new products, that are beautifully designed, tech- nologically advanced, easy to use, and sold in appealing stores that offer a fun experi- ence, knowledgeable staff, and excellent service. By differentiating itself in this manner from its competitors Apple has been able to charge prices for its products that are well above those of its rivals and far exceed the low cost of its inputs. Its expansion poli- cies have allowed the company to make it easy for customers to find an Apple store in almost any high-quality mall or urban shopping district, further enhancing the brand and cementing customer loyalty. A creative distinctive strategy such as that used by Apple is a company’s most reliable ticket for developing a competitive advantage over its rivals. If a strategy is not distinctive, then there can be no competitive advantage, since no firm would be meeting customer needs better or operating more efficiently than any other.", "answer": "Memorized."}

First, a clear and reasoned strategy is management’s prescription for doing business, its road map to competitive advantage, its game plan for pleasing customers, and its formula for improving performance. High-performing enterprises are nearly always the product of astute, creative, and proactive strategy making. Companies don’t get to the top of the industry rankings or stay there with flawed strategies, copycat strate- gies, or timid attempts to try to do better. Only a handful of companies can boast of hitting home runs in the marketplace due to lucky breaks or the good fortune of having stumbled into the right market at the right time with the right product. Even if this is the case, success will not be lasting unless the companies subsequently craft a strategy that capitalizes on their luck, builds on what is working, and discards the rest. So there can be little argument that the process of crafting a company’s strategy matters—and matters a lot.\nSecond, even the best-conceived strategies will result in performance shortfalls if they are not executed proficiently. The processes of crafting and executing strategies must go hand in hand if a company is to be successful in the long term. The chief executive officer of one successful company put it well when he said\nIn the main, our competitors are acquainted with the same fundamental concepts and techniques and approaches that we follow, and they are as free to pursue them as we are. More often than not, the difference between their level of success and ours lies in the relative thoroughness and self-discipline with which we and they develop and execute our strategies for the future.\nGood Strategy + Good Strategy Execution = Good Management\nCrafting and executing strategy are thus core management tasks. Among all the things managers do, nothing affects a company’s ultimate success or failure more fundamen- tally than how well its management team charts the company’s direction, develops competitively effective strategic moves, and pursues what needs to be done internally to produce good day-in, day-out strategy execution and operating excellence. Indeed, good strategy and good strategy execution are the most telling and trustworthy signs of good management. The rationale for using the twin standards of good strategy mak- ing and good strategy execution to determine whether a company is well managed is therefore compelling: The better conceived a company’s strategy and the more com- petently it is executed, the more likely the company will be a standout performer in the marketplace. In stark contrast, a company that lacks clear-cut direction, has a flawed strategy, or can’t execute its strategy competently is a company whose financial per- formance is probably suffering, whose business is at long-term risk, and whose man- agement is sorely lacking.", "answer": "Memorized."}

The answer that emerges is that doing a good job of managing inherently requires good strategic thinking and good management of the strategy-making, strategy-executing process.\nThe mission of this book is to provide a solid overview of what every busi- ness student and aspiring manager needs to know about crafting and executing strategy. We will explore what good strategic thinking entails, describe the core concepts and tools of strategic analysis, and examine the ins and outs of crafting and executing strategy. The accompanying cases will help build your skills in both diagnosing how well the strategy-making, strategy-executing task is being performed\n\nand prescribing actions for how the strategy in question or its execution can be\nimproved. The strategic management course that you are enrolled in may also include a strategy simulation exercise in which you will run a company in head- to-head competition with companies run by your classmates. Your mastery of the strategic management concepts presented in the following chapters will put you in a strong position to craft a winning strategy for your company and figure out how to execute it in a cost-effective and profitable manner. As you progress through the chapters of the text and the activities assigned during the term, we hope to con- vince you that first-rate capabilities in crafting and executing strategy are essential to good management.\nAs you tackle the content and accompanying activities of this book, ponder the following observation by the essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Commerce is a game of skill which many people play, but which few play well.” If your efforts help you become a savvy player and better equip you to succeed in business, the time and energy you spend here will indeed prove worthwhile.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Can the company’s prospects be improved by changing its product offerings, or the markets in which it participates, or the customers it aims to serve? Deciding to commit the company to one path versus another pushes managers to draw some carefully reasoned conclusions about whether the company’s present strategic course offers attractive opportunities for growth and profitability or whether changes of one kind or another in the com- pany’s strategy and long-term direction are needed.\n\nDeveloping a Strategic Vision\nTop management’s views about the company’s long-term direction and what\nproduct-market-customer business mix seems optimal for the road ahead consti- tute a strategic vision for the company. A strategic vision delineates management’s aspirations for the company’s future, providing a panoramic view of “where we are going” and a convincing rationale for why this makes good business sense. A stra- tegic vision thus points an organization in a particular direction, charts a strategic path for it to follow, builds commitment to the future course of action, and molds organizational identity. A clearly articulated strategic vision communicates manage- ment’s aspirations to stakeholders (customers, employees, stockholders, suppliers, etc.) and helps steer the energies of company personnel in a common direction. The vision of Google’s cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” provides a good example. In serving as the company’s guiding light, it has captured the imagination of stakeholders and the public at large, served as the basis for crafting the company’s strategic actions,\nand aided internal efforts to mobilize and direct the company’s resources.\nWell-conceived visions are distinctive and specific to a particular organization; they avoid generic, feel-good statements like “We will become a global leader and the first choice of customers in every market we serve.”2 Likewise, a strategic vision proclaim- ing management’s quest “to be the most innovative” or “to be recognized as the best company in the industry” offers scant guidance about a company’s long-term direction or the kind of company that management is striving to build.\nA surprising number of the vision statements found on company websites and in annual reports are vague and unrevealing, saying very little about the company’s future direction. Some could apply to almost any company in any industry. Many read like a public relations statement—high-sounding words that someone came up with because it is fashionable for companies to have an official vision statement.3 An example is Hilton Hotel’s vision “to fill the earth with light and the warmth of hospitality,” which simply borders on the incredulous. The real purpose of a vision statement is to serve as a management tool for giving the organization a\nsense of direction.\nFor a strategic vision to function as a valuable management tool, it must con- vey what top executives want the business to look like and provide managers at all organizational levels with a reference point in making strategic decisions and preparing the company for the future. It must say something definitive about how the company’s leaders intend to position the company beyond where it is today.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Paint a clear picture of where the company is headed and the market position(s) the company is striving to stake out.\n \nDon’t be vague or incomplete. Never skimp on specifics about where the company is headed or how the company intends to prepare for the future.\n \nBe forward-looking and directional. Describe the strategic course that will help the company prepare for the future.\n \nDon’t dwell on the present. A vision is not about what a company once did or does now; it’s about “where we are going.”\n \nKeep it focused. Focus on providing managers with guidance in making decisions and allocating resources.\n \nDon’t use overly broad language. Avoid all-inclusive language that gives the company license to pursue any opportunity.\n \nHave some wiggle room. Language that allows some flexibility allows the directional course to be adjusted as market, customer, and technology circumstances change.\n \nDon’t state the vision in bland or uninspiring terms. The best vision statements have the power to motivate company personnel and inspire shareholder confidence about the company’s future.\n \nBe sure the journey is feasible. The path and direction should be within the realm of what the company can accomplish; over time, a company should be able to demonstrate measurable progress in achieving the vision.\n \nDon’t be generic. A vision statement that could apply to companies in any of several industries (or to any of several companies in the same industry) is not specific enough to provide any guidance.\n \nIndicate why the directional path makes good business sense. The directional path should be in the long-term interests of stakeholders (especially shareholders, employees, and suppliers).\n \nDon’t rely on superlatives. Visions that claim the company’s strategic course is the “best” or “most successful” usually lack specifics about the path the company is taking to get there.\n \nMake it memorable. A well-stated vision is short, easily communicated, and memorable. Ideally, it should be reducible to a few choice lines or a one-phrase slogan.\n \nDon’t run on and on. A vision statement that is not concise and to the point will tend to lose its audience.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Each of these involves different facets of the company’s overall strategy and calls for the participation of different types of manag- ers, as shown in Figure 2.2.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2.2, corporate strategy is orchestrated by the CEO and other senior executives and establishes an overall strategy for managing a set of busi- nesses in a diversified, multibusiness company. Corporate strategy concerns how to improve the combined performance of the set of businesses the company has diver- sified into by capturing cross-business synergies and turning them into competitive advantage. It addresses the questions of what businesses to hold or divest, which new markets to enter, and how to best enter new markets (by acquisition, creation of a strategic alliance, or through internal development, for example). Corporate strategy and business diversification are the subjects of Chapter 8, in which they are discussed in detail.\nBusiness strategy is concerned with strengthening the market position, building competitive advantage, and improving the performance of a single line of business. Business strategy is primarily the responsibility of business unit heads, although corporate-level executives may well exert strong influence; in diversified companies it is not unusual for corporate officers to insist that business-level objectives and strategy conform to corporate-level objectives and strategy themes. The business\nhead has at least two other strategy-related roles: (1) seeing that lower-level strategies are well conceived, consistent, and adequately matched to the overall business strat- egy; and (2) keeping corporate-level officers (and sometimes the board of directors) informed of emerging strategic issues.\nFunctional-area strategies concern the approaches employed in managing par- ticular functions within a business—like research and development (R&D), produc- tion, procurement of inputs, sales and marketing, distribution, customer service, and finance. A company’s marketing strategy, for example, represents the managerial game plan for running the sales and marketing part of the business. A company’s product development strategy represents the game plan for keeping the company’s product lineup in tune with what buyers are looking for.\nFunctional strategies flesh out the details of a company’s business strategy. Lead responsibility for functional strategies within a business is normally delegated to the heads of the respective functions, with the general manager of the business having final approval. Since the different functional-level strategies must be compatible with the overall business strategy and with one another to have beneficial impact, there are times when the general business manager exerts strong influence on the content of the functional strategies.\nOperating strategies concern the relatively narrow approaches for managing key operating units (e.g., plants, distribution centers, purchasing centers) and specific operating activities with strategic significance (e.g., quality control, materials purchas- ing, brand management, Internet sales). A plant manager needs a strategy for accom- plishing the plant’s objectives, carrying out the plant’s part of the company’s overall manufacturing game plan, and dealing with any strategy-related problems that exist at the plant. A company’s advertising manager needs a strategy for getting maximum audience exposure and sales impact from the ad budget. Operating strategies, while of limited scope, add further detail and completeness to functional strategies and to the overall business strategy. Lead responsibility for operating strategies is usually del- egated to frontline managers, subject to the review and approval of higher-ranking managers.\nEven though operating strategy is at the bottom of the strategy-making hierarchy, its importance should not be downplayed. A major plant that fails in its strategy to achieve production volume, unit cost, and quality targets can damage the company’s reputation for quality products and undercut the achievement of company sales and profit objectives. Frontline managers are thus an important part of an organization’s strategy-making team. One cannot reliably judge the strategic importance of a given action simply by the strategy level or location within the managerial hierarchy where it is initiated.\nIn single-business companies, the uppermost level of the strategy-making hierarchy is the business strategy, so a single-business company has three levels\nof strategy: business strategy, functional-area strategies, and operating strategies. Proprietorships, partnerships, and owner-managed enterprises may have only one or two strategy-making levels since it takes only a few key people to craft and oversee the firm’s strategy. The larger and more diverse the operations of an enterprise, the more points of strategic initiative it has and the more levels of management that have a sig- nificant strategy-making role.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\nUniting the Strategy-Making Hierarchy\nThe components of a company’s strategy up and down the strategy hierarchy should\nbe cohesive and mutually reinforcing, fitting together like a jigsaw puzzle. Anything less than a unified collection of strategies weakens the overall strategy and is likely to impair company performance.13 It is the responsibility of top executives to achieve this unity by clearly communicating the company’s vision, mission, objectives, and major strategy components to down-the-line managers and key personnel. Midlevel and frontline managers cannot craft unified strategic moves without first understand- ing the company’s long-term direction and knowing the major components of the corporate and/or business strategies that their strategy-making efforts are supposed to support and enhance. Thus, as a general rule, strategy making must start at the top of the organization, then proceed downward from the corporate level to the busi- ness level, and then from the business level to the associated functional and operat- ing levels. Once strategies up and down the hierarchy have been created, lower-level strategies must be scrutinized for consistency with and support of higher-level strate- gies. Any strategy conflicts must be addressed and resolved, either by modifying the lower-level strategies with conflicting elements or by adapting the higher-level strategy to accommodate what may be more appealing strategy ideas and initiatives bubbling up from below.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nA Strategic Vision + Mission + Objectives + Strategy = A Strategic Plan\nDeveloping a strategic vision and mission, setting objectives, and crafting a strategy are basic direction-setting tasks. They map out where a company is headed, delin- eate its strategic and financial targets, articulate the basic business model, and out- line the competitive moves and operating approaches to be used in achieving the desired business results. Together, these elements constitute a strategic plan for cop- ing with industry conditions, competing against rivals, meeting objectives, and mak- ing progress along the chosen strategic course.14 Typically, a strategic plan includes a commitment to allocate resources to carrying out the plan and specifies a time period for achieving goals.\nIn companies that do regular strategy reviews and develop explicit strategic plans, the strategic plan usually ends up as a written document that is circulated to most managers. Near-term performance targets are the part of the strategic plan most often communicated to employees more generally and spelled out explicitly. A num- ber of companies summarize key elements of their strategic plans in the company’s annual report to shareholders, in postings on their websites, or in statements provided\nto the business media; others, perhaps for reasons of competitive sensitivity, make only vague, general statements about their strategic plans.15 In small, privately owned com- panies it is rare for strategic plans to exist in written form. Small-company strategic plans tend to reside in the thinking and directives of owner-executives; aspects of the plan are revealed in conversations with company personnel about where to head, what to accomplish, and how to proceed.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nSTAGE 4: EXECUTING THE STRATEGY\nManaging the implementation of a strategy is easily the most demanding and time- consuming part of the strategic management process. Converting strategic plans into actions and results tests a manager’s ability to direct organizational change, motivate company personnel, build and strengthen competitive capabilities, create and nurture a strategy-supportive work climate, and meet or beat performance targets. Initiatives to put the strategy in place and execute it proficiently must be launched and managed on many organizational fronts.\nManagement’s action agenda for executing the chosen strategy emerges from assessing what the company will have to do to achieve the financial and strategic performance targets. Each company manager has to think through the answer to the question “What needs to be done in my area to execute my piece of the strate- gic plan, and what actions should I take to get the process under way?” How much internal change is needed depends on how much of the strategy is new, how far inter- nal practices and competencies deviate from what the strategy requires, and how well the present work culture supports good strategy execution. Depending on the amount of internal change involved, full implementation and proficient execution of the company strategy (or important new pieces thereof) can take several months to several years.\nIn most situations, managing the strategy execution process includes the following principal aspects:\n• Creating a strategy-supporting structure.\n• Staffing the organization to obtain needed skills and expertise.\n• Developing and strengthening strategy-supporting resources and capabilities.\n• Allocating ample resources to the activities critical to strategic success.\n• Ensuring that policies and procedures facilitate effective strategy execution.\n• Organizing the work effort along the lines of best practice.\n• Installing information and operating systems that enable company personnel to perform essential activities.\n• Motivating people and tying rewards directly to the achievement of performance objectives.\n• Creating a company culture conducive to successful strategy execution.\n• Exerting the internal leadership needed to propel implementation forward.\nGood strategy execution requires diligent pursuit of operating excellence. It is a job for a company’s whole management team. Success hinges on the skills and cooperation of operating managers who can push for needed changes in their orga- nizational units and consistently deliver good results. Management’s handling of the strategy implementation process can be considered successful if things go smoothly enough that the company meets or beats its strategic and financial performance targets and shows good progress in achieving management’s strategic vision. In Chapters 10, 11, and 12, we discuss the various aspects of the strategy implementa- tion process more fully.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nSTAGE 5: EVALUATING PERFORMANCE AND INITIATING CORRECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS\nThe fifth component of the strategy management process—monitoring new external developments, evaluating the company’s progress, and making corrective adjustments— is the trigger point for deciding whether to continue or change the company’s vision and mission, objectives, strategy, business model and/or strategy execution methods.16 As long as the company’s strategy continues to pass the three tests of a winning strat- egy discussed in Chapter 1 (good fit, competitive advantage, strong performance), company executives may decide to stay the course. Simply fine-tuning the strategic plan and continuing with efforts to improve strategy execution are sufficient.\nBut whenever a company encounters disruptive changes in its environment, ques- tions need to be raised about the appropriateness of its direction and strategy. If a company experiences a downturn in its market position or persistent shortfalls in per- formance, then company managers are obligated to ferret out the causes—do they relate to poor strategy, poor strategy execution, or both?—and take timely corrective action. A company’s direction, objectives, business model, and strategy have to be revisited anytime external or internal conditions warrant.\nLikewise, managers are obligated to assess which of the company’s operating methods and approaches to strategy execution merit continuation and which need improvement. Proficient strategy execution is always the product of much organiza- tional learning. It is achieved unevenly—coming quickly in some areas and proving troublesome in others. Consequently, top-notch strategy execution entails vigilantly searching for ways to improve and then making corrective adjustments whenever and wherever it is useful to do so.", "answer": "Memorized."}

Oversee the company’s financial accounting and financial reporting practi\nWhile top executives, particularly the company’s CEO and CFO (chief financial officer), are primarily responsible for seeing that the company’s financial state- ments fairly and accurately report the results of the company’s operations, board members have a legal obligation to warrant the accuracy of the company’s financial reports and protect shareholders. It is their job to ensure that gener- ally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are used properly in preparing the company’s financial statements and that proper financial controls are in place to prevent fraud and misuse of funds. Virtually all boards of directors have an audit committee, always composed entirely of outside directors (inside directors hold management positions in the company and either directly or indirectly report to the CEO). The members of the audit committee have the lead responsibility for overseeing the decisions of the company’s financial officers and consulting with both internal and external auditors to ensure accurate financial reporting and adequate financial controls.\n2. Critically appraise the company’s direction, strategy, and business approaches. Board members are also expected to guide management in choosing a strategic direction and to make independent judgments about the validity and wisdom of management’s proposed strategic actions. This aspect of their duties takes on heightened importance when the company’s strategy is failing or is plagued with faulty execution, and certainly when there is a precipitous collapse in prof- itability. But under more normal circumstances, many boards have found that meeting agendas become consumed by compliance matters with little time left to discuss matters of strategic importance. The board of directors and management at Philips Electronics hold annual two- to three-day retreats devoted exclusively to evaluating the company’s long-term direction and various strategic proposals. The company’s exit from the semiconductor business and its increased focus on medical technology and home health care resulted from management-board dis- cussions during such retreats.", "answer": "Memorized."}

No need more any comments.\n\nAirbnb in 2020\nA BUSINESS MODEL FOR THE COVID ECONOMY\nIn 2019, Airbnb finally announced that the long- awaited IPO would occur during 2020, and Airbnb’s revenues were estimated to reach over $2 billion—see Exhibit 4. However, Airbnb dampened expectations with the announcement that it had experienced a net loss of over $300 million through September 2019 due to increases in operating costs.13 Then, in the spring of 2020, the pandemic and efforts by the subsequent state and local governments to stop the spread of COVID-19 presented a significant threat to Airbnb and its business model. Instead of preparing for the IPO, Airbnb had to raise $2 billion in private equity funding and debt to support operations dur- ing the pandemic.14, 15 And in May 2020, Airbnb announced 1900 employees, or about one quarter of the workforce, would be let go Quickly, Airbnb tried to adjust its business opera- tions. As guests cancelled their stays with hosts, Airbnb adjusted its cancellation policy. Normally, hosts had dis- cretion over how to handle cancellations. Due to travel restrictions imposed by state and local governments, guests were forced to cancel their stays. Yet some hosts were still charging these guests based on their own cancellation policies. In response, Airbnb adjusted the policy by offering refunds for reservations made prior to March 14, 2020, through the end of June 2020.\nAirbnb also offered safety and cleaning guide- lines for its hosts. Given the nature of the pandemic, it had become paramount to ensure cleanliness. A guest or a host contracting COVID-19 due to an Airbnb stay could most certainly make people reluc- tant to use Airbnb in the future.\nFor the hosts, however, the loss of the revenue streams seemed to be the most immediate problem. Many hosts depended on their revenue from rentals to afford the properties they owned, either as private homes or as short-term rental properties. Over the years, many hosts had built their finances around the anticipated revenue from guests. Since the pandemic began, some hosts reported they had experienced monetary losses in the tens of thousands of dollars. To support hosts, Airbnb established a $17 million fund to help support hosts that had acquired long- term status with Airbnb\nTo confront the challenges of the pandemic, Airbnb expanded its sharing-economy model by entering the “Online Experiences” market. Virtual experiences, such as cigar tastings and virtual guided tours of cities were all being offered for patrons to book and experience from their own home–whether or not they were under stay-at-home orders. It was clear that in 2020, if Airbnb was going to successfully navigate the pandemic, it would have to consider what else people may be willing to share, albeit virtually, in a pandemic economy", "answer": "Memorized."}

{"prompt": "", "input": "Act as a math commentary that describes the process of solving a math problem.\n\nThis math commentary performs the process of solving a math problem follows this process:\nAll numbers and formulas must be output in katex for easy recognition.\n\nStep 1: Given a problem, look at each word and figure out which math category it belongs to. \"Context\" is established when the words relate to each other in the same math category. For example, \"the equation x^3-6x^2+9x+k=0 for x\" is not simply \"algebra\" or \"equation\"; it's \"a cubic equation for x with an unknown constant. For every \"context\", identify the meaning of that \"context\", the mathematical procedure derived from that meaning, and the mathematical operations that depend on that mathematical procedure.\n\nStep 2: Figure out what to look for in the problem. Let's call the object to be saved \"goal\". Among the \"contexts\" we looked at in the step 1, we look at the math categories related to \"goal\". So we check the components to get the \"goal\". If necessary, double-check the \"context\" explored in the step 1 and the mathematical category containing the component. Check mathematical procedures and mathematical operations to find components according to mathematical procedures.\n\nStep 3: Identify mathematical procedures and corresponding mathematical operations that can connect the methods explored in the step 1 and 2. For each mathematical procedure and mathematical operation explored, it predicts semantically, not computationally, whether a \"goal\" can be achieved.\n\nStep 4: Each answer is determined according to the mathematical procedure predicted to be possible in the step 3 and the corresponding mathematical operation. Connect the given numbers and variables in the problem according to the chosen mathematical procedure and the resulting mathematical operation. Simplify expressions as needed to reduce characters and operations. In this context, simplify means to use a mathematical procedure, mathematical method, or mathematical operation to reduce the number of characters, reduce the order of characters, or reduce the number of terms.

There is a fullness in the joint. The pain and swelling came on gradually with no trauma or other precipitating event. The elbow pain is aggravated by bending and straightening and she cannot fully straighten her elbow. The elbow pain and restricted range of motion (ROM) make it harder for her to perform her activities of daily living, such as brushing her teeth, lifting, cooking, and housecleaning and she is finding it challenging to work. The pain can keep her up at night. She volunteers that mornings are a difficult time because of pain and morning stiffness in the right elbow, which lasts about one hour. She denies fever, chills or sweats.\nMs. Johnny has had no recent or concurrent illnesses, such as infections, that she is aware of. She has not started any new drugs recently. There was no injury of the elbow. In her past medical history, she had an appendectomy years ago. She has had no other medical problems. She has no prior history of elbow symptoms or other joint symptoms, no history of psoriasis of the skin or nails.\nShe takes very minimal alcohol socially. She has smoked a 1/2 pack of cigarettes a day for about 15 years, ongoing. She likes to walk and hike and often swims at the local community centre pool.\nOn family history, her father has a history of gout. Her mother has psoriasis but no arthritis. There is no other family history of arthritis.\nShe is not aware of any tuberculosis (TB) infection herself; however, one year ago, she was exposed to a resident at the care home she works at, who had active pulmonary TB.\nShe has some mild discomfort in her shoulder regions, which she ascribes to muscle strain from transferring patients at work. Her left elbow is a bit painful but not swollen and she believes it is because she is trying to protect her painful right arm.

{"prompt": "", "input": "Please use the socratic method to teach me all of the following lesson section. Do not answer the questions yourself, and only ask me one question at a time.\n\nSplitting Up a Commit\nBefore diving into Remotes, we’re going to have a look at a handy Git command called reset. Let’s have a look at the commit Create third file and create fourth file. At the moment we’re using blank files for convenience, but let’s say these files contained functionality and the commit was describing too much at once. In that case what we could do is split it up into two smaller commits by, once again, using the interactive rebase tool.\n\nWe open up the tool just like last time, change pick to edit for the commit we’re going to split. Now, however, what we’re going to do is run git reset HEAD^, which resets the commit to the one right before HEAD. This allows us to add the files individually, add, and commit them individually. All together it would look something like this:\n\n$ git reset HEAD^\n$ git add test3.md && git commit -m 'Create third file'\n$ git add test4.md && git commit -m 'Create fourth file'\nLet’s start by looking a bit closer at what happened here. When you ran git reset, you reset the current branch by pointing HEAD at the commit right before it. At the same time, git reset also updated the index (the staging area) with the contents of wherever HEAD is now pointed. So our staging area was also reset to what it was at the prior commit - which is great - because this allowed us to add and commit both files separately.\n\nNow let’s say we want to move where HEAD points to but don’t want to touch the staging area. If we want to leave the index alone, you can use git reset --soft. This would only perform the first part of git reset where the HEAD is moved to point somewhere else.\n\nThe last part of reset we want to touch upon is git reset --hard. What this does is it performs all the steps of git reset, moving the HEAD and updating the index, but it also updates the working directory. This is important to note because it can be dangerous as it can potentially destroy data. A hard reset overwrites the files in the working directory to make it look exactly like the staging area of wherever HEAD ends up pointing to. Similarly to git commit --amend, a hard reset is a destructive command which overwrites history. This doesn’t mean you should completely avoid it if working with shared repositories on a team with other developers. You should, however, make sure you know exactly why you’re using it, and that your coworkers are also aware of how and why you’re using it.", "answer": "What is the Git command used to reset the current branch to the commit right before it?"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "It's `reset`", "answer": "What is the purpose of running `git reset HEAD^`?"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "Well, it resets the commit to the one right before HEAD. But, I don't know what HEAD is.", "answer": "What is `HEAD` in Git and what does it represent?"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "what's the significance of `^` in `git reset HEAD^`", "answer": "The caret (^) symbol in `git reset HEAD^` specifies the parent of the current commit, which in this case is the commit right before the current one. So `git reset HEAD^` will reset the current branch to the commit before the current one."}

{"prompt": "", "input": "Business RFP\nFinancial Rationale\nThe financials of the business RFP’s that we received were subdivided and calculated in\nthree parts, first by sleeping room requirements, second by meeting room requirements, and third\nby food and beverage needs. The initial needs of the group were calculated and then services fees\nand taxes were included to give a rough estimation on the Grand Total of the event.\nFigure 1 represents the corporate sleeping room needs. The peak number of room nights\nand total room nights were taken directly from the provided RFP’s, if attrition was not disclosed\nin the RFP we assumed 90% as the standard, however, attrition is a negotiable point if we\ndecided to move forward with the RFP.\nThe Standard Rate was based on the standard rate offered by the hotel for those dates\nfound on Hyatt’s website, and the sleeping room subtotal was determined by multiplying the\nstandard rate by the total room nights. For the group ACC the standard rate is for accomodations\nin Hyatt House, since the group is made up of board members and sponsors we assumed the best\naccommodations would be in the king bedrooms in the Hyatt House and a standard upgrade\nwould be a studio room. For the client we refer to as “Hi Kim” we chose Hyatt Place due to the\nvolume of room nights, and the need for both double and single occupancy rooms which Hyatt\nHouse does not offer. Global Cynergies’ client budgeted $150 per room so we placed them in\nHyatt Place and are able to stay below budget once the group rate discount is applied.\nThe room block discount is set at a standard 15% for all groups. However, this is\nsomething that would be up for negotiation later on. The Group Rate Subtotal is the sleeping\nroom total after the discount has been applied and Total is the final price for sleeping room\naccomodations after sales and accommodations tax are applied (both rates are set by the SC\nDepartment of Revenue). Once the total has been summed up we divided it by the total number\nof room nights to receive the average per person.\nFigure 1\nFigure 2 demonstrates the breakdown for meeting space cost. The meeting space chosen\nis based on the amount of attendees of the event. More detail on meeting and food and beverage\nspecs can be found in the BRM’s in the appendix.\nThe meeting room rates were pulled from the rates on the Sterling Hall cost sheet for\nHyatt House/Place, and then this rate is multiplied by the number of days that the room will be\nreserved and totaled with the combined meeting space required. For example, ACC will need the\nentire Magnolia Ballroom for an 85 person annual meeting. The whole ballroom will be used but\ndivided into two sections. Two of the three sections will be used for the meeting space in banquet\nstyle, and the other third will be divided by a wall and hold the breakfast and lunch buffets that\nguest can then take back to their seats. This gives the client the separation between meeting\nspace and food spreads they requested, and it allows the banquet staff to transition from one meal\nto the next, set-up and clean without disrupting the meeting. This same formula was used for “Hi\nKim” and Global Cynergies, elaborating on what room style would best suit the meeting function\nand finding the appropriately sized space, if there was a time where we were just over the max\ncapacity we always opted for a larger room.\nOnce the subtotal for the room space rental was determined additional service fees were\napplied. The exhibit charge did not apply to any of our RFP’s so it always rang up to zero. The\nhotel service fee comes from the Sterling Hall packet from Hyatt which states that 22% is the\nHotel administrative fee and that all prices and services are subject to this charge. The room\nrental and audio/visual tax rate is 9% as stated in the Sterling Hall packet from Hyatt, and wifi is\noffered complimentary to guests in both their sleeping and meeting rooms. The summation of\nthese taxes and fees with the subtotal of the room rental gives the cost estimation of the meeting\nspace.\nFigure 2\nHyatt can make a profit in addition to sleeping and meeting rooms on food and beverage\noffered during meetings. By adding food and alcohol services Hyatt can require a servers per an\namount of people. For example, the price for a bartender is $125.00 for the first two hours and\neach hour after is an additional $30.00. A bartender is required for every 70 people. Therefore,\nan event that requires a cocktail hour reception can be huge profit for Hyatt.\nA major factor we considered when selecting the RFPs was the ratio between guests and\nsleeping rooms. The amount of sleeping rooms each client needed to the meeting space they take\nup is in correlation to price and profit. For example, \" Hi Kim\" brings in 136 total room nights, 10\ntotal uses of meeting space and $20,530.60 in food. Food and beverage is another profit making\nservice that Hyatt can provided guests.\nFigure 3\nProduct- Market Match\nACC\nThe Association of Corporate Counsel Chapter Annual Meeting is an event that is for a\ngroup based out of Columbia, SC and hosts about 75-100 guests from throughout the state.\nPrevious hosts have both been in Columbia, South Carolina.\nSince the group is already from South Carolina the\nseasonality is not something that will sway their choice to\ncome here, the weather for Charleston in September is\nsomething they are accustomed to and the rate for this time\nof year is comparable to rates you would receive in\nColumbia. Because this corporation and the attendees are\nfrom the state it will be easy to sell them on the destination\nof Charleston because, it is a departure from where the event\nwas the last two years and the meeting will still be in-state but will provide new opportunities.\nThe amount of rooms and meeting space they are requesting is reasonable, especially\nbecause it is taking place in a month that is hard to sell. ACC would take up 21% of Hyatt Place\nsleeping rooms, and occupy 25% of the meeting rooms over the course of the stay cumulatively\n(shown in Figure A ). This presents about a 1:1 ratio for sleeping rooms to meeting rooms. This\ngroup is coming on shoulder nights (Sunday-Tuesday) and during the hot summer months, when\nsales are low. This is a good ratio because it leaves plenty of empty space in the combined Hyatt\nHouse/Place to sell to additional corporate groups, and enough meeting space as well. The group\nwill also require catering and A/V needs, the A/V needs will provide a high margin along with\nthe sleeping rooms that is attractive.\nBecause ACC wanted to book their visit during the low season we extend the offer of the\ngroup rate three days post which carry into the weekend. We assumed most will decide not to\nstay, but those that do will give us valuable room nights for September weekdays.\nThe group is one we highly considered because the RFP language is clear and concise, it\nis easy to read and the group appears like they will be easy to plan with since they have a vision\nfor what they want for layout and itinerary.\n\"Hi Kim\"\nThe most important note to make on the group we refer to as “Hi Kim” is they are second-hold\nfor these same dates. They are great business opportunity but\nthere is another group currently in negotiations for the same\nweekend that- we assume- requires similar needs as this group\nwhich would not allow both groups to book at Hyatt.\nThe group “Hi Kim” is coming during the high season of\nCharleston, near the end of May, and does not include their\nmeeting history or information about their group. Based on the\nfamiliarity in the RFP letter we assume this group is familiar\nwith Charleston and the prices they generally requested of\ngroups, especially in May, and the group is aware they are on\nhold but is still eager to come visit so they would be a group\neasy to sell to and negotiate with.\nThe group requires 136 room nights in Hyatt Place, 24% of the hotel’s sleeping rooms,\nand 31% of the cumulative meeting rooms (shown in Figure B ). The rooms ratio is close to 1:1\nfor sleeping rooms to meeting rooms. The group would be occupy a large portion of the hotel’s\nsleeping roms cumulatively. This is a large amount of sleeping room to occupy for the high\nseason with a low amount of sleeping rooms. Given that the time of the stay is during\nCharleston’s high season, a group with a 1:1 ratio is very practical, especially given high amount\nof leisure travelers.\nThe group “Hi Kim” would need substantial A/V, and food & beverage needs, the A/V\nwould provide high margins however, food & beverage is not one of the better profit drivers for\nthe hotel. Since another piece of business is already on the books for this time of year we did not\noffer them a proposal. However, this is a group that we would like to build a relationship with\nand suggest booking with us at a later date.\nGlobal Cynergies’ Client\nGlobal Cynergies is a third party representing an unnamed client. The meeting is for a small\ngroup of young corporate marketing leaders looking for a destination with fun restaurants and activities\nnearby. This is the first time the meeting is being held. The group is considering Nashville, Asheville, and\nAdairsville as other options, all comparable to Charleston in one way or another but lacking the whole\npackage that only Charleston can offer. The group would be a\ngood match for the Charleston Hyatt because the area is\nsurrounding is youth-centric, there’s an endless supply of bars\nand restaurants for anyone’s taste, all a walkable distance\nfrom the hotel, including the Pour Taproom on top of the\nH yatt. Even though this group is comprised of only 12\npeople, it is a young group and they are a marketing\nleadership team, hinting that there is potential for the\nteam/company will grow and become a repeat client.\nThe group wants to come on shoulder nights in\nAugust, which are generally hard to fill nights in a low\nseason for Charleston, these dates would be a nice piece\nof business to bring in and fill late summer holes. The group has 24 total room nights in the\nHyatt Place, taking up a total of 6% of the hotel’s sleeping rooms but they require 3 full days of\nmeeting space in the Carolina room equaling about 8% of meeting rooms, (shown in Figure C ).\nThis is about a 1:1 ratio of sleeping rooms to meeting rooms, but still a large percentage of\nmeeting rooms and sleeping rooms would remain open. The hotel will have plenty of sleeping\nrooms to provide to leisure travelers and the meeting space they are occupying will be fairly\ninconsequential if other groups require meeting space at the same time.\nThe group will also provide a high profit margin because they need rooms and A/V\nrequirements, and they will also require food & beverages throughout the whole day of their\nmeetings charged per consumption.", "answer": "What specific question do you have regarding the business RFP?"}

{"prompt": "", "input": "Part 1: Auxiliary classes and functions (utility file)\nFor example, class UnreliableSocket and PacketHeader can be defined in this file.\nClass UnreliableSocket defines an unreliable socket that ‘inherits’ several functions\nand the unreliable features of UDP sockets. The ‘inherited’ functions include bind(),\nrecvfrom(), sendto() and close(). Function recvfrom() should simulate packet loss,\npacket delay and packet corruption scenarios.\nClass PacketHeader specifies the format of RDT packets. There should also be some\nadditional auxiliary functions. compute\\_checksum() calculates the crc32 checksum\nvalue and verify\\_packet() verifies the integrity of the received segments. Both\nfunctions will be needed when encapsulating and processing RDT packets.\nYou can implement other necessary functions or classes in this component as well.\nPart 2: reliable data transfer sockets\nYou can define class RDTSocket in this component. This class can inherit all the\nmethods and properties from class UnreliableSocket. There are five key functions\nyou need to implement:\n• accept(): Similar to the accept function defined in TCP protocol, it is invoked\nby the receiver to establish ‘connections’ with the sender. The return value is\nthe address (tuple of IP and port number) of the sender. You do not need to\ncreate a new connection socket like TCP does.\n• connect(): Similar to the connect function defined in TCP, it is invoked by\nthe sender to initiate connection request with the receiver.\n\n• send(): This function is invoked by the sender to transmit data to the receiver.\nThis function should split the input data into appropriately sized chunks of data,\nand append a checksum to each packet. seq\\_num should increment by one for\neach additional segment in a connection. Please use the compute\\_checksum()\nfunction provided in util.py for the 32-bit CRC checksum.\n• recv(): This function is invoked by the receiver to receive data from the\nsender. This function should reassemble the chunks and pass the message back\nto the application process. Use the verify\\_packet() function to check the\nintegrity of the segments.\n• close(): This function is invoked by the sender to terminate the connection\nbetween the sender and the receiver.\nWhen implementing send() and recv(), you MUST use the sendto() and recvfrom()\nfunctions defined in the utility file.\nYou will implement reliable transport using a sliding window mechanism. The size of\nthe window (window\\_size) will be specified in the command line. The sender must\naccept cumulative ACK packets from the receiver.\nAfter transferring the entire message, the sender will send an END message to mark the\nend of connection.\nThe sender must ensure reliable data transfer under the following network conditions:\n• Packet loss;\n• Reordering of ACK messages;\n• Duplication of any amount for any packet;\n• Delay in the arrivals of ACKs.\nTo handle cases where ACK packets are lost, you should implement a 500 ms\nretransmission timer to automatically retransmit segments that were not\nacknowledged. Whenever the window moves forward (i.e., some ACK(s) are received\nand some new packets are sent out), you reset the timer. If after 500 ms the window\nstill has not advanced, you retransmit all segments in the window because they are all\nnever acknowledged (not just the missing segment).\nThe receiver needs to handle only one sender at a time and should ignore START\nmessages while in the middle of an existing connection. It should also calculate the\nchecksum value for the data in each segment it receives with its header information.\n\nIf the calculated checksum value does not match the checksum provided in the\nheader, it should drop the packet (i.e. not send an ACK back to the sender).\nFor each segment received, it sends a cumulative ACK with the seq\\_num it expects to\nreceive next. If it expects a packet of sequence number N, the following two scenarios\nmay occur:\n1. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num not equal to N, it will send back an ACK\nwith seq\\_num=N. Note that this is slightly different from the Go-Back-N\n(GBN) mechanism discussed in class. GBN totally discards out-of-order\npackets, while here the receiver buffers out-of-order packets.\n2. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num=N, it will check for the highest sequence\nnumber (say M) of the in-order packets it has already received and send ACK\nwith seq\\_num=M+1.\nIf the next expected seq\\_num is N, the receiver will drop all packets with seq\\_num\ngreater than or equal to N + window\\_size to maintain a window\\_size window.\nPart 3: a sender and a receiver\nThe sender and receiver application process are programmed with the socket APIs\nimplemented in Part 2. The sender transmits a text file, alice.txt, to the receiver.\nThe receiver will write the received data to file download.txt.\nFor example, the sender can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython sender.py [Receiver IP] [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n• Receiver IP: The IP address of the host that the receiver is running on.\n• Receiver Port: The port number on which the receiver is listening.\n• Window Size: Maximum number of in-flight segments.\nThe receiver can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython receiver.py [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n• Receiver Port: The port number on which receiver is listening for data.\n• Window Size: Receiver window size.\n\nTo test your code, you could compare download.txt with alice.txt with the\nfollowing commands:\ndiff download.txt alice.txt\nIf nothing is printed, then your code is correct.\n\nTips\n\no You could assume the communication between the sender and receiver is half-\nduplex, which means that only the sender is allowed to send data to the\n\nreceiver.\no To implement timer, you could calculate the time elapsed between the current\ntime and a previous timestamp. If this value exceeds 500 ms, then a timeout\nevent happens.\no You do not need to consider efficiency when implementing this protocol. Thus,\nthere is no need to implement concurrency in your code.\n\nREMINDERS\no All your source code should be placed in a directory. Submit your code to\nCanvas in a zip file by running command in terminal:\nzip -r [you-case-id]-proj-2.zip [project directory]\no If your code could not run, you will not get credits.\no All student code will be scanned by plagiarism detection software to ensure that\nstudents are not copying code from the Internet or each other. We will\nrandomly check student's code to make sure that it works correctly.\no Document your code (by inserting comments in your code)", "answer": "I understand that you need help implementing a reliable data transfer protocol using sliding windows in Python.

{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 3 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". The Appeal\n\nIn its appeal Toplace stated that the Tribunal made errors of law with respect to both aspects of the damages awarded. In relation to the award of compensation for damage to personal property, Toplace submits that Dr Rashidianfar should have been required to mitigate his loss and, in particular, should have removed all his personal belongings from the property to prevent damage. It is also submitted that any award should not have been made for the cost of the replacement of the damaged goods with new items but should have been at the value of the damaged items.\n\nToplace also argues that the Tribunal Member erred in awarding damages for loss of rent. Toplace disputes that Dr Rashidianfar intended to rent out his apartment while he was in Wagga Wagga. Toplace also argues that, at the time he purchased the property, Dr Rashidianfar did so as an owner occupier and remained an owner occupier until he moved to Wagga Wagga on 4 February 2019. As we understand it, Toplace argues that it could not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into, that is, at the time of purchase, that Dr Rashidianfar would suffer loss of rent from the breach, that is, the defective building work which resulted in water ingress.\n\nIn his reply to the appeal, Dr Rashidianfar states that all of the matters raised in the appeal by Toplace were considered by the Tribunal Member. He notes that before the Tribunal Toplace conceded that there was a major defect and that damage was caused to his property. He states he moved the items he had left at the apartment away from the location of the previous leaks but that the flooding event on 8 February 2019 resulted in water ingress in other areas.\n\nDr Rashidianfar also notes that at the hearing Toplace conceded that the property was uninhabitable from 2 February 2019 to 18 August 2019 and states that the evidence he provided showed he wanted to rent the apartment out but could not because of its condition and the delay in having the repairs done.\n\nApplicable legal principles – internal appeals\n\nSection 80(2)(b) of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 ( NCAT Act) states:\n\nAny internal appeal may be made:\n\n(a) in the case of an interlocutory decision of the Tribunal at first instance - with the leave of the Appeal Panel, and\n\n(b) in the case of any other kind of decision (including an ancillary decision) of the Tribunal at first instance—as of right on any question of law, or with the leave of the Appeal Panel, on any other grounds.\n\nIn the present appeal Toplace states that it is appealing on questions of law. In Prendergast v Western Murray Irrigation Ltd [2014] NSWCATAP 69 the Appeal Panel set out at [13] a non-exclusive list of questions of law:\n\nWhether there has been a failure to provide proper reasons;\n\nWhether the Tribunal identified the wrong issue or asked the wrong question;\n\nWhether a wrong principle of law had been applied;\n\nWhether there was a failure to afford procedural fairness;\n\nWhether the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant (i.e., mandatory) considerations;\n\nWhether the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration;\n\nWhether there was no evidence to support a finding of fact; and\n\nWhether the decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would make it.\n\nToplace has not identified with any particularity the precise nature of the errors it submits the Member made in his decision. In relation to the claim for compensation in respect of the personal property of Dr Rashidianfar damaged by mould etc, it appears that Toplace does not dispute liability but is arguing that the Member applied the wrong principles to the assessment of damages. In relation to the claim for loss of rent, Toplace appears to submit that there was no evidence to support the Tribunal’s finding that Dr Rashidianfar intended to rent out his apartment. In addition, Toplace argues that loss of rental income from the breach could not have been within the contemplation of the parties when he purchased the apartment. It therefore argues that the Tribunal applied a wrong principle of law to its assessment.\n\nFor the reasons which appear below we are satisfied that the Tribunal made an error of law with respect to its assessment of the claim for lost rent.\n\nConsideration\n\nCompensation for damage to personal belongings\n\nThe Member correctly identified the general rule as set out in Robinson v Harman (1848) 154 ER 363, and which has been applied in Australia, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, the party is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed. Toplace, although not couching it in these terms, appears to argue that, by awarding Dr Rashidianfar the cost of replacement goods, Dr Rashidianfar was better off than he otherwise would have been if the damage had not occurred.\n\nAt the hearing before the Tribunal, Toplace conceded that the defects in the property led to damage to Dr Rashidianfar’s goods. We see no reason to depart from that concession and the Member’s findings as we agree that damage to Dr Rashidianfar’s personal belongings in the apartment arose naturally from the breach, namely water ingress as a result of defective waterproofing.\n\nToplace, although it disputed the amount claimed, provided no evidence that the amounts were excessive or unreasonable. The Tribunal referred to the High Court’s judgment in Commonwealth v Amman Aviation Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 6. That case is authority for the proposition that the onus for proving the loss rests with the person claiming it. It was also said in that case that that mere difficulty in estimating damages does not relieve a court (or tribunal) from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can.\n\nIn our view, on the state of the evidence before him, it was open to the Member to award the amount he did.\n\nIn relation to mitigation, the Member’s reasons do not specifically refer to mitigation, although do note that Toplace argued that Dr Rashidianfar should have moved his goods from the property to prevent damage. It is well established that damages cannot be recovered for any loss which could have been prevented by reasonable mitigation action of the injured party: [23.41] Cheshire and Fifoot: Law of Contract 10th Edition. A loss which is attributable to the failure to mitigate can be regarded as an aspect of causation: Castle Constructions Pty Ltd v Fekula Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 133 at [21].\n\nThe action that must be taken in mitigation is only that which is reasonable. In his reasons the Member noted that the premises provided to Dr Rashidianfar in Wagga Wagga were fully furnished and that when he left for Wagga Wagga it was his intention to rent out his apartment as fully furnished. He also notes that the damage occurred after Dr Rashidianfar left for Wagga Wagga. Unfortunately, the Member does not explicitly go on to address what, if any, reasonable steps could have been taken by him in mitigation. However, it is implicit from his decision that he was not of the view that, in the circumstances, Dr Rashidianfar should have removed his goods from premises, particularly where the major inundation occurred after he had left for Wagga Wagga.\n\nAt the hearing before us, Toplace also sought to argue that Dr Rashidianfar should not have locked his apartment up and should have arranged for his parents to air it out to prevent a build-up of mould. This does not appear to have been argued before the Member and, in any event in our view, is not what would be reasonably required in the circumstances.\n\nWe find no error in the Member’s approach to the issue of damages.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 4 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". Loss of rent\n\nAt the hearing before us Toplace’s representative accepted that there was defective work and that the company had responsibility to repair the defective work, although sought to distance herself from the statement made by the person who attended the Tribunal hearing on the company’s behalf that the premises owned by Dr Rashidianfar were uninhabitable between 2 February 2019 and 18 August 2019. A party is bound by the manner in which it conducted its own case and it is not now open for Toplace to dispute the concession which was made by its representative at the hearing.\n\nDr Rashidianfar purchased the apartment in July 2017 from the previous owner, Zheng Zhang, and thus became the successor in title and able to make a building claim in reliance upon the statutory warranties set out in s 18B of the Home Building Act 1989 (see s 18D of the Home Building Act). A claim for a breach of statutory warranties is a contractual claim and subject to the contractual measure of damages as set out in Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613; [1954] HCA 36 (see Allianz v Waterbrook [2009] NSWCA 224 at [69]; Building Insurers’ Guarantee Corporation v The Owners – Strata Plan No. 57504 [2010] NSWCA 23 at [61]-[62]).\n\nIn Leeda Projects v Zeng (2020) 61 VR 384; [2020] VSCA 192 Kaye JA at [12] set out the following in relation to contractual damages (citations omitted):\n\nThe fundamental principles, for the determination of damages for breach of contract, are well established. Essentially, damages are awarded in order to compensate the injured party for the loss and damage arising from the breach of contract. Thus, damages consist of the sum of money which will put the injured party in the same position as if the breach of contract had not occurred. In order to determine the appropriate measure of damages in a particular case, it is necessary first to identify the kind of loss for which the injured party claims compensation. The loss, which is compensable in an action for breach of contract, is that which may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally, that is, according to the usual course of things, from the breach of contract itself, or such as may be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.\n\nAs was stated by Lord Reid in C Czarnikow Limited v Koufos [1969] 1 AC 350 at 385:\n\nThe crucial question is whether, on the information available to the defendant when the contract was made, he should, or the reasonable man in his position would, have realised that such loss was sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract to make it proper to hold that the loss flowed naturally from the breach or that loss of that kind should have been within his contemplation.\n\nThe principle enunciated by Lord Reid and referred to by Kaye J in Leeda Projects is generally known as the principle in Hadley v Baxendale.\n\nWe accept that under a claim for breach of a statutory warranty a successor in title is able to claim for damage flowing from the breach by the builder. The successor in title must, however, prove that a loss was sustained and that there was an appropriate causal connection between the loss and the breach of the statutory warranties (Allianz v Waterbrook at [71]). We accept that the cost or repairs may be awarded as damages in this context or the builder be ordered to undertake remedial work.\n\nIn his decision, as noted above, the Member referred to Hadley v Baxendale and framed the question that he had to answer as being whether the loss of rent was in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract. We agree that this was a correct characterisation of the issue as it could not be said that loss of rent arises naturally from the breach. In this context we note that repairs to the apartment were carried out by Toplace and that it was liable for the damage to Dr Rashidianfar’s personal property which occurred as a direct result of the breach.\n\nToplace submits that it could not have been in contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract that Dr Rashidianfar would suffer loss of rental income from the defective work which allowed water to enter the apartment. Toplace does not identify the relevant contract but states that, to its knowledge, Dr Rashidianfar purchased the apartment to live in and up until the time he went to Wagga Wagga was an owner occupier.\n\nHadley v Baxendale requires an assessment of what could be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it. We agree with Toplace that the relevant time for assessment of what was in the parties contemplation is the time at which the contract was entered into. The Member in his reasons refers to a contract and seems to make a temporal connection between the date of the breach – 2 February 2019 and ongoing – and Toplace’s liability for damages, particularly as at that time Dr Rashidianfar had stated he intended to rent the property and had taken some steps in that regard. The Member, however, does not specify what contract he is referring to or when that contract was entered into. No information has been provided which would support any contention that a contract was entered into between Toplace and Dr Rashidianfar around that time. As noted above, Toplace appears to indicate that the relevant time for the assessment was at the time Dr Rashidianfar purchased the apartment.\n\nWe are not aware of any authority concerning the meaning of “at the time the contract was entered into” in the context of a claim by a successor in title in reliance upon the statutory warranties under the Home Building Act when assessing damages for the consequence of a breach under what is often described as the second limb in Hadley v Baxendale. When making this assessment, what then is the contract and the relevant time for assessment of what could be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties?\n\nThe statutory warranties are implied into every building contract by virtue of s 18B of the Home Building Act. It is clear that Dr Rashidianfar was not a party to the building contract but is able, through the legislative provisions, to take advantage of those warranties as successor in title. There is no separate contract between the builder and the successor in title. In effect, the successor in title subsumes the rights under the building contract to enforce the statutory warranties against the builder who was a party to the building contract. The builder, of course, is only responsible for works contracted for under the building contract and the time within which those warranties may be enforced runs from the date of completion of the building work (see s 18E). We also note that under s 18BA(2) the successor in title is under the same duty to mitigate as the original contracting party.\n\nAs can be seen from the matters referred to in the previous paragraph, the rights of a successor in title to enforce the warranties are, with good reason, tied back to the original building contract. In our view, the relevant time for the assessment of whether loss of the kind claimed should have been within the contemplation of the parties is the time at which the building contract was entered into.\n\nIn our opinion, the Tribunal was in error in assessing what may have reasonably been in completion by the parties at the time the breach occurred in February 2019 and Dr Rashidianfar moved to Wagga Wagga. This was a misunderstanding of the applicable principles in Hedley v Baxendale and was an error of law.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

New hearing\n\nIn accordance with s 80(3)(a) of the NCAT Act, we consider that the grounds of appeal warrant a new hearing by us. However, we do not consider that it is appropriate to permit any fresh evidence, given that the parties had an adequate opportunity to provide all the evidence on which they wished to rely to the Tribunal.\n\nAs a consequence of the Tribunal’s error and because of the approach it took in determining the claim, findings about whether loss of rent may be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of the builder at the time the building contract was entered into need to be made. We think it appropriate for us to proceed to determine this issue in the interests of the efficient disposition of the dispute between the parties, particularly bearing in mind the limited material that needs to be examined and that no issues arise concerning the credit of witnesses.\n\nThe cases that have dealt with whether the loss of the kind claimed may be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of the party against whom the claim is made indicate that some knowledge of the relevant circumstances and an undertaking of the risk, whether that be express or implied, are required (see Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd [1949] 2 KB 528; Diamond v Campbell-Jones [1961] Ch 22). Bergin J in Sumy Pty Ltd v Southcorp Wines Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1000 at [77], after reviewing cases in the area, albeit in relation to a contract for the sale of land, noted that there must be some specific knowledge at the time of entering the contract. The person claiming damages must be able to show that, in this case, loss of rent, was more than merely one of a range of foreseeable outcomes (Castle Constructions Pty Ltd v Fekala Pty Ltd (2006) 65 NSWLR 648 at [52]).\n\nThe following cases illustrate that there be must be some knowledge on the part of the builder at the time the contract is entered into. In Bui v DB Homes Australia Pty Ltd [2017] NSWCATAP 218 in hearing an appeal from homeowners in relation to claimed loss of rental income as a result of delay by the builder in completing the construction of a granny flat, the Appeal Panel noted at [28] that it cannot be assumed that the mere fact that someone is building a granny flat is for the purposes of rental. Similarly, in Ippolito v Cesco [2020] NSWSC 561 Ball J did not allow a claim for lost rent in circumstances where at the time the building contract was entered into it was not anticipated that the premises would be rented out.\n\nNeither party has provided any evidence of the date of the building contract in relation to the development in which Dr Rashidianfar’s apartment is located. We note, however, from correspondence sent to Dr Rashidianfar by the solicitors for the owners corporation on 10 July 2019 that an occupation certificate was issued on 11 November 2016.\n\nThe documents provided by Dr Rashidianfar show that Zheng Zhang bought the apartment from the developer and that settlement in relation to that purchase was in March 2017. Dr Rashidianfar signed a contract with Dr Zhang to purchase the apartment on 22 July 2017. There was a 28 day settlement period in the contract and he and his wife occupied the property some two months later.\n\nOn 23 May 2019 Dr Rashidianfar was offered a position by NSW Health as a Basic Trainee in Psychiatry managed by Concord Hospital. He was advised that during his employment he may need to work at other facilities, including at rural hospitals.\n\nOn 19 August 2019 Ms Larissa Mouawad on behalf of Toplace wrote to Dr Rashidianfar about a range of issues. In relation to his claim for loss of rent she stated: “Toplace’s understanding from previous communication with your family and yourself is that the apartment was owner occupied and you would be returning to your apartment after your leave.” Relevant documents provided by both parties indicate that Dr Rashidianfar first communicated with Toplace about his intent to rent out the apartment in January 2019.\n\nAn email from Dr Rashidianfar’s father to Ms Mouawad (no date supplied, but in response to her email of 19 August 2018) states that Dr Rashidianfar intended to rent out the unit “while he was away for six months”. Other correspondence provided by Dr Rashidianfar shows that he was employed for a six month period in Wagga Wagga from 2 February 2019 to 4 August 2019. During that period he was provided with a fully furnished two bedroom house. He told us at the hearing that it was not until June 2019 that he signed a further contract and therefore knew he would be returning to Sydney in August.\n\nWhile we do not have information before us about when the contract to build the apartments was entered into, it is clear from the available material that it would be some time before November 2016 when the first occupation certificate was issued. The contract clearly precedes Dr Rashidianfar’s purchase of the apartment in 2017 and was certainly entered into prior to him being sent to Wagga Wagga in February 2019 as part of his traineeship. It was only in January 2019 that he formed an intent to rent out his apartment.\n\nIn our view, it could not reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the builder at the time the building contract was entered into that a successor in title to an original owner may be transferred to a regional location for work for a six month period and may wish to rent out his apartment during that period and, presuming a tenant is found, would suffer loss of rent. The builder would have no way of knowing that such circumstances were foreseeable and likely to arise from a breach by the builder of the contract.\n\nWe therefore find that loss of rent is not something that ought reasonably to have been within Toplace’s contemplation at the time the contract was entered into so as to fall within the principles stated in Hadley v Baxendale. Dr Rashidianfar is therefore not entitled to damages for lost rent and we make orders accordingly.\n\nOrders\n\nWe make the following order:\n\nAppeal allowed in part.\n\nOrder 2 made in matter HB 19/42035 on 18 March 2020 is set aside.\n\nIn substitution, Toplace Pty Ltd is to pay Amirsalar Rashidianfar the sum of $11,167.15 by 20 August 2021.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

At that stage, the Council orally sought leave to amend its pleadings to incorporate a claim for liquidated damages. In opposing this application, Beckhaus, submitted (as the Master observed):\n\n“The [Contract] was discharged by implied agreement through the parties’ mutual abandonment of the [Contract] in or about early 2002.”\n37 On 7 December 2004 Master Macready handed down a further judgment.\n38 He noted that the parties had agreed that the amount owing in respect of his findings on the cross-claim was $40,000.\n39 In dealing with the application by the Council to amend so as to claim liquidated damages, the Master rejected Beckhaus’ argument that the Contract had been abandoned or terminated. In doing so, he appears to have assumed that Beckhaus’ contentions were based on the proposition that, by mutual agreement, the Contract had been rescinded ab initio. (Mr Rudge SC who, together with Mr Robertson, appeared for Beckhaus, disavowed to this Court having submitted at trial that the Contract had been so rescinded). The Master held that neither party had evinced such an intention.\n40 It appears that the Council accepted before the Master that, by reason of extensions of time to which Beckhaus was probably entitled, the date for practical completion (in respect of both Separable Portions A and B of the Contract) should be taken to be 31 March 2002. That being so, under the Contract the claim for liquidated damages could run from no earlier date.\n41 Master Macready upheld Beckhaus’ submission that the Council was precluded from claiming liquidated damages after 27 May 2002. His reasoning was as follows. He held that the Council had failed to pay progress claim No 7 unconditionally. On the basis of that finding, Beckhaus, in terms of s 27(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act, had lawfully suspended work on 27 May 2002. It followed, the Master held, that the superintendent, acting reasonably, would have extended time for practical completion until unconditional payment was made. Accordingly, work (and practical completion) remained lawfully suspended as at the judgment date. Under the Contract, there could be no claim for liquidated damages for the period during which the time for practical completion was so suspended (that is, during the period from 27 May 2002 to the date of judgment).\n42 The Master noted that there had been “no identification of any determination” of the Contract (the Council was then contending that the Contract had not been terminated). He said:\n\n“The parties have not identified any matter in the present evidence that would be an end date [for the period of liquidated damages] and the likelihood is that any entitlement to liquidated damages will only arise following upon some other facts which lead to a termination of the contract after the present time.”\n43 For this reason, and the relatively small amount that, on the Master’s reasons, the Council could claim (that is, based only on a “likely” period of about two months – from not earlier than 31 March 2002 to 27 May 2002) the Master declined to give leave to plead a claim for liquidated damages.\n44 The Master turned to Variation 21. The gist of this claim was that, in breach of the Contract, the superintendent had failed to provide Beckhaus with a list of defects upon Beckhaus asserting that practical completion had been reached. Beckhaus contended that this failure caused it to keep its major earthmoving equipment at Brewarrina and entitled it to delay costs, alternatively to damages.\n45 Master Macready appears, however, to have upheld this claim on a different basis, namely, because the Council had substantially failed in its cross-claim, there was no practical need for Beckhaus to have kept its equipment on site as the superintendent had required. The Master said:\n\n“It is apparent from discussions, which took place on 3 April 2002 between the Council and [Beckhaus], that the Council was raising a large number of matters which might require further work by [Beckhaus]. The matter escalated into the service of notices of dispute on about 24 April 2002 and accordingly it was probably reasonable for [Beckhaus] to keep its equipment on site until the time claimed namely 27 April 2002. In my view [Beckhaus] is entitled to this variation.”", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe orders made by the Master\n46 Relevantly, Master Macready made orders:\n(1) Granting a verdict and judgment in favour of Beckhaus in the sum of $809,236.54.\n\n(2) Granting a verdict and judgment in favour of the Council on its cross-claim in the sum of $40,000.\n\n(3) Otherwise dismissing the cross-claim.\n\n(4) Ordering the Council to pay Beckhaus interest in the sum of $135,772.99.\n\n(5) “In consolidation” of the orders referred to in (1), (2) and (3) above, granting a verdict and judgment in favour of Beckhaus in the sum of $905,009.53.\n\n(6) Ordering the Council to pay Beckhaus’ costs on various basis.\n\n(7) Ordering the Council to pay Mr Beckhaus’ costs of the cross-claim.\n47 The sum of $905,009.53 (the “consolidated” verdict) appears to have been arrived at as follows. By adding interest in the sum of $135,772.99 (as ordered by the Master – see (4) above) to the verdict of $809,236.54 (see (1) above), the sum of $945,009.53 is arrived at. $945,009.53 less the amount of $40,000 awarded to the Council (see (2) above) is $905,009.53.\n48 I assume that the judgment sum of $809,236.54 is the aggregate of progress claim No 7 and Variation 17. There is, however, no specific mention of Variation 21 in the orders that were made. According to the Council’s notice of appeal the amount awarded in respect of Variation 21 was $101,560. I can only assume that this sum formed part of the award of interest. The parties did not explain these matters to the Court.\nThe notice of appeal and the notice of contention\n49 By its notice of appeal the Council, in summary, contended that Master Macready erred in the following respects:\n(a) In holding that the Council was not entitled to damages for Beckhaus’ breach of the Contract in failing to provide test results indicating that compaction around the culverts complied with the specification.\n\n(b) In holding that the Council was not entitled to damages for Beckhaus’ breach of the Contract in failing to add 3% lime to the material to be compacted.\n\n(c) In holding that the Council was not entitled to damages for Beckhaus’ breach of the Contract in failing to achieve linear shrinkage not exceeding 12%.\n\n(d) In holding that the levees were compacted in accordance with the specification.\n\n(e) In holding that the Contract was a divisible contract, that there had been substantial performance by Beckhaus and that the Council’s claim for total failure of consideration was unsuccessful.\n\n(f) In holding that the condition precedent to the issuing of a payment certificate by the superintendent (in respect of progress claim No 7) had been satisfied.\n\n(g) In holding that, in accordance with the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act , Beckhaus was entitled to payment of progress claim No 7.\n\n(h) In holding that Beckhaus was entitled to payment of Variation 17.\n\n(i) In holding that Beckhaus was entitled to payment of Variation 21.\n\n(j) In ordering that the Council pay the costs of Beckhaus and Mr Beckhaus.\n\n(k) In refusing the Council’s application to amend so as to claim liquidated damages.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

I would add that there was a notice of cross-appeal filed by Beckhaus which, in effect, has been subsumed by the issues raised in the notice of appeal and the notice of contention.\nClaiming damages for defective performance while the Contract was on foot\n53 The notice of contention raises the question whether the Contract was terminated by mutual agreement. The Council long denied this proposition but, on the third day of the appeal, assented to it. Despite the Council’s late acceptance of the proposition, the question remains relevant as it exposes a misconception by both parties in the way the issues were addressed at trial. The misconception was that the Council could claim damages from Beckhaus for defective and incomplete work while the work was still in Beckhaus’ possession and while Beckhaus was still obliged (and entitled) to execute the work to practical completion. This misconception permeated the conduct of the case by all involved and complicated the identification of the true issues in the case.\n54 The reason for the Council’s stand is not hard to find. It lies in cl 35.6 of the General Conditions which provided:\n\n‘If [Beckhaus] fails to reach Practical Completion by the date for Practical Completion, [Beckhaus] shall be indebted to [the Council] for liquidated damages at the rate stated in the Annexure for every day after the Date for Practical Completion to and including the Date of Practical Completion or the date that the Contract is terminated under Clause 44, whichever first occurs.”\n\nThe Council wished to assert that the Contract remained on foot so as to enable it to make a large claim for liquidated damages. Thus, the Council believed that it was in its interests to contend that the Contract had not been terminated but, at the same time, to claim damages for defective and incomplete work.\n55 It is helpful to identify Beckhaus’ obligations to perform the work under the Contract, Beckhaus’ rights to be paid for its work, and the Council’s rights in respect of breaches of the Contract by Beckhaus. Once those obligations and rights are identified, consideration must be given as to whether there was an agreed termination and, if so, how they were affected by the agreed termination.\n56 By cl 3.1 of the General Conditions, Beckhaus undertook to execute and complete the work under the Contract and the Council undertook to pay Beckhaus:\n\n“(a) for work for which the [Council] accepted a lump sum, the lump sum;\n(b) for work for which the [Council] accepted rates, the sum ascertained by multiplying the measured quantity of each section or item of work actually carried out under the contract by the rate accepted by the [council] for the section or item,\nadjusted by any additions or deductions made pursuant to the contract.”\n\nThus, by cl 3.1, the Council’s obligation was to pay Beckhaus for the work executed and completed.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

Thus, by cl 30.3, the Council was entitled to require Beckhaus to remedy defective work before the Council was obliged to pay for it.\n58 Clause 35.2 provided that Beckhaus should execute the work under the Contract to the stage of practical completion by the date for practical completion. Beckhaus was obliged, on the date of practical completion, to give possession of the site and the work to the Council and, on that date, the Council was obliged to accept possession.\n59 At least while the Contract endured, until practical completion was achieved Beckhaus had no obligation and no right to deliver the work to the Council and the Council had no right to take possession of the work.\n60 The Contract provided that the date for practical completion of Separable Portion A was 20 weeks after “Date of Acceptance of Tender” and for Separable Portion B “10 weeks after commencement date for Separable Portion B”. Mr Christie, who together with Ms Culkoff, appeared for the Council, accepted that the superintendent probably would have allowed extensions of time to the dates for practical completion until about March 2002. This is not a matter on which any concession was forthcoming from Beckhaus, but it may be accepted that the dates for practical completion were not earlier than March 2002.\n61 By cl 37, the defects liability period commenced on the date of practical completion. In terms of cl 37, Beckhaus was obliged to rectify any defects or omissions in the work existing at practical completion. Prior to the fourteenth day after the expiration of the defects liability period, the superintendent could direct Beckhaus to rectify any omission or defect in the work existing at the date of practical completion or which became apparent prior to the expiration of the defects liability period.\n62 Clause 42.1 provided for the payment of progress claims; it stated:\n\n“Payment of monies shall not be evidence of the value of work or an admission of liability or evidence that work has been executed satisfactorily but shall be a payment on account only ….”\n\nThus, a payment of a progress claim was a payment on account.\n63 Clause 44.1 provided:\n\n“If a party breaches or repudiates the Contract, nothing in Clause 44 shall prejudice the right of the other party to recover damages or exercise any other right.”\n64 Clause 44.5 provided that, should the Council take the work out of Beckhaus’ hands, the Council should complete the work. Clause 44.6 provided:\n\n“When work taken out of the hands of [Beckhaus] under Clause 44.4(a) is completed the Superintendent shall ascertain the cost incurred by the [Council] in completing the work and shall issue a certificate to the [Council] and [Beckhaus] certifying the amount of that cost.\nIf the cost incurred by the [Council in completing the work] is greater than the amount which would have been paid to [Beckhaus] if the work had been completed by [Beckhaus], the difference shall be a debt due from [Beckhaus] to the [Council]. If the cost incurred by the [Council] is less than the amount that would have been paid to [Beckhaus] if the work had been completed by [Beckhaus], the difference shall be a debt due to [Beckhaus] from the [Council].”\n65 No provision of the Contract prevented the Council from suing Beckhaus for damages for breach of contract under common law; but that is not to say that, simply by reason of a failure, by the date for practical completion, to complete the work to the standard required, the Council would be entitled to damages for defective or incomplete work.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

Master Macready upheld this assertion and, for reasons that I later set out, I have come to the same conclusion.\n67 Accordingly, as at the judgment date, the Council rightly denied that practical completion had been achieved. But, it continued - at that stage - to hold Beckhaus to its contractual obligations to perform the work. Thus, on the Council’s contention, at the date of judgment, the work remained in Beckhaus’ possession; the Council, in effect, having refused to accept possession.\n68 While, on this assumption (the Contract still being on foot), the Council may have been entitled to claim damages for delay arising out of Beckhaus’ failure to achieve practical completion by the date for practical completion, it could not sue Beckhaus for defective or incomplete work. As long as the Council maintained that the Contract was alive and had not been terminated, and held Beckhaus to its obligation to complete the work in accordance with the specification, on its contention the work remained lawfully in Beckhaus’ possession. In other words, it was an inevitable incident of the Council’s argument that the work had not been delivered to and accepted by the Council (Beckhaus – on the Council’s argument – being in possession of and obliged to complete the work). While the work was in Beckhaus’ possession, the Council suffered no loss by reason of defective or incomplete work; the work, not being in the Council’s possession, did not at that stage form part of its patrimony.\n69 This situation would have changed when the Contract was terminated. When that occurred, the work (in its defective and incomplete state) was handed over to the Council. At that stage, the Council suffered loss by being in possession of defective and incomplete work.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 12 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe agreed termination of the Contract\n70 When Mr Christie eventually accepted that the Contract had been terminated by tacit agreement, the Council thereby, in effect, conceded the point made by Beckhaus’ notice of contention (although the date of termination was left open). Mr Christie’s concession was rightly made; the conclusion that the parties agreed, by their conduct, to terminate the Contract was inevitable. I shall set out a brief summary of the facts relevant to this issue.\n71 On 18 March 2002 Beckhaus claimed that it had achieved practical completion and requested the superintendent to issue a certificate to that effect. The superintendent failed to do so and requested Beckhaus to produce various test certificates. Beckhaus gave the superintendent certain test results (but not all that had been requested) and on 26 April 2002 submitted progress claim No 7. The superintendent did not issue a certificate of practical completion and, on 27 April 2002, Beckhaus removed its major plant from the site.\n72 On 22 May 2002 Beckhaus served a notice of intention to suspend work pursuant to s 15(2)(b) of the Act. On 27 May 2002 Beckhaus suspended work in reliance on s 27 of the Act for failure to pay progress claim No 7. On 22 August 2003 Beckhaus wrote to the Council asserting that the Contract had not been terminated and was still in existence (this appears to have been an attempted forensic tactic, rather than a step connected to reality).\n73 From the time that Beckhaus left the site, the attitudes of the parties began to harden and, in my opinion, by no later than 15 March 2004 – when the trial commenced - both parties tacitly accepted that the Contract was at an end. Beckhaus contended that it might have come to an end earlier but this issue depends on a factual inquiry that was not properly investigated at the trial and cannot be determined by this Court. The actual commencement of the hearing of lengthy and expensive litigation, directed to a final resolution of the parties’ rights, was conduct by both parties manifesting an intention wholly inconsistent with any continuing obligation of performance on either side.\n74 Master Macready considered the issue of termination on the assumption that the parties had agreed to rescind the contract ab initio. It is open, however, to parties to a contract to agree that the contract is to be terminated on the basis that there is a mutual release from future performance only and that rights accrued to the date of termination will remain of full force and effect. See, for example, CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cases 61-232 at 75-594 per Powell JA (and as to abandonment, generally, see Ryder v Frohlich [2004] NSWCA 472 per McColl JA).\n75 In any event, the issue is now concluded by reason of the Council’s late concession that the Contract was terminated by agreement on the latter basis.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe effect of the agreed termination on Beckhaus’ claim for unpaid work and the cross-claims\n76 I have observed that a progress claim is a claim for payment on account (see cl 42.1). As the Contract has been terminated, it is no longer appropriate for Beckhaus to be awarded any sum “on account”. The financial position between the parties now has to be determined finally.\n77 The Contract contains elaborate provisions as to the determination of amounts that, on completion of the Contract, the Council might owe to Beckhaus or Beckhaus might owe to the Council. The Contract, however, (by agreement) was not completed.\n78 I have above referred to and set out cl 44.6 of the Contract. This clause regulates the settlement of accounts between the parties in the event of the work being taken out of the hands of Beckhaus and being completed by some other party (on the Council’s behalf). Clause 44.6 provides, in effect, that, were Beckhaus to commit a material breach of the Contract and were the Council to take the work out of its hands and have it completed by another contractor (as provided in cl 44. 4(a)), a balance would be struck between:\n\n(a) the cost to the Council of completing the work (including the amounts it paid to Beckhaus under the Contract), and\n(b) the amount the Council would have paid to Beckhaus (including amounts due for variations affecting the cost of the work) if all the work had been duly completed by it in accordance with the Contract.\n\nIt makes no difference whether the amounts previously paid to Beckhaus are or are not included in both these amounts.\n79 In my view, it was implicit in the termination agreement that neither party would be worse off by reason of that agreement than it would have been had the Contract been terminated in accordance with its terms. In my view, the parties impliedly agreed that their respective rights on termination would be governed, mutatis mutandis, by those provisions of the Contract that applied on completion. In my opinion, although the termination agreement did not trigger cl 44.6 (because the work was not taken out of the hands of Beckhaus under cl 44.4(a) and was not completed), it was implicit in the termination agreement that the formula provided by the clause would operate upon termination. That formula is commercially fair and appropriate and there was no reason for the parties to depart from it.\n80 Thus, were Beckhaus to prove that the Council would incur less costs in having the work under the Contract rectified and completed in accordance with the Contract than the amount it would have paid to Beckhaus if the latter had duly completed all the work in accordance with the Contract, Beckhaus would be entitled to be paid the difference (that being the balance struck in accordance with the formula contained in cl 44.6). In the present circumstances, where the work has not been rectified and completed, the onus, in my opinion, lies on Beckhaus – in establishing its claim that there is a balance owing to it – to prove the elements of the formula resulting in that balance, including what rectification and completion would cost.\n81 A claim on the basis of such an implied term is not a claim for a quantum meruit in the sense of being a restitutionary claim “outside the contract” (see Trimis v Mina (1999) 16 BCL 288 at 295 [52] per Mason P). Beckhaus’ claim on this basis is a claim under the Contract as varied by the termination agreement.\n82 Beckhaus’ claim was not put in this way at the trial and, understandably, was not dealt with in this way by the Master. Beckhaus’ claim, as represented by progress claim No 7, was simply a claim on account.\n83 The reason why Beckhaus’ claim was not so dealt with at the trial was that neither party appreciated the significance of the agreed termination of the Contract. From the material before the Court (including progress claim No 7), it appears that Beckhaus did a substantial amount of work in accordance with the Contract for which it was not paid; but it is not certain that Beckhaus has proved that the cost of completing the work would be less than the amount than the Council would have paid it had it duly completed the work. The matters necessary to complete the work are also the subject of cross-claims which were rejected by the Master and which should be re-assessed; but it is also not clear that the Council has established a balance owing to it. Although I later deal with these as cross-claims by Council, it is to be kept in mind that the same matters also concern the deficiencies in respect of which Beckhaus bears an onus of proof as far as its claim is concerned.\n84 In my opinion, in the light of the mutual misconception by the parties, justice requires the issue of the amount that may be owing to Beckhaus or the Council under the Contract as varied by the termination agreement to be remitted to Master Macready (now Macready AsJ). This, essentially, requires a re-examination of the work, the subject of progress claim No 7, in the light of these reasons. Regard must be had to the implied term of the termination agreement governing the final financial position of the parties, and those aspects of the Council’s appeal in respect of its cross-claims which I would uphold on the ground that work done by Beckhaus was not in accordance with the Contract and needs to be rectified and completed. This Court is not in a position to undertake this inquiry and the parties did not ask it to do so.\n85 With respect to the cross-claims, the Council would only be entitled to judgment for an amount payable by Beckhaus to it were Macready AsJ to find, on re-assessment, that the Council would incur greater costs in having the work rectified and completed in accordance with the Contract than the amount it would have paid to Beckhaus if the latter had duly completed the work. The Council would then be entitled to be paid the difference between the two amounts.\n86 It may be helpful if some hypothetical amounts are taken to illustrate the position. Assume that, had Beckhaus completed the work in accordance with the Contract, the cost to the Council would have been $2.5 mill. Assume that the Council has already paid Beckhaus $1.8 mill and the cost to it of completing the work in accordance with the Contract is $300,000. Beckhaus would then be entitled to be paid $400,000 (being $700,000 – the difference between $2.5 mill and $1.8 mill - less $300,000). The deficiencies the subject of the Council’s cross-claims would be taken into account in arriving at this result and no amount would be payable to it. If, however, the cost of completing the work in accordance with the Contract is $800,000, the Council would then be entitled to be paid $100,000 (being $800,000 less $700,000) and Beckhaus would receive nothing further.\n87 I reiterate that, as regards Beckhaus’ claim, the onus is on Beckhaus to prove to prove what rectification and completion would cost and what the Council would have paid it if it had completed the work in accordance with the Contract. As regards the cross-claims, the onus lies on the Council to prove these matters.\n88 I should add that, on all issues that are to be remitted to Macready AsJ, it will be entirely a matter for him whether fresh evidence should be allowed.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nVariation 17\n89 Variation 17 is a claim by Beckhaus based on the following item in the Schedule of Prices:\n\n“Stabilise excavated borrow material with 5% gypsum (by dry weight) and condition (excavation included in other items).”\n\nThe quantity of material that appeared in the Schedule of Prices for this item was 47,370 tons.\n90 Beckhaus argued that additional soil had to be excavated over and above that allowed for in the Contract. As Master Macready put it, there was “no item for the stabilisation of the additional material”. It was on this basis that the Master upheld this variation.\n91 The Council contended, however, that Variation 17 should not have been allowed as the work done by Beckhaus in respect thereof was not in accordance with the Contract. This submission was based on Beckhaus’ failure to add 3% meadow lime to all the material the subject of the item in question.\n92 Beckhaus contended that its obligation under the Contract was to achieve a minimum of 12% linear shrinkage of the material and lime only had to be added to the extent necessary to achieve this percentage. It contended that it was not obliged, absolutely, to add 3% lime to all the material.\n93 I do not accept Beckhaus’ submission. Clause 8.10 is clear in its terms and imposes a separate and independent obligation on Beckhaus to add 3% lime to all the material. Mr Rudge acknowledged that the addition of lime to soil can affect its linear shrinkage, its dispersion characteristics and – to the extent that lime might affect its dispersion characteristics – the capacity of the soil to erode. These are all matters that concern the effectiveness of the levees. These were relevant reasons for the Contract to require the addition of 3% lime to all the material used and, in my view, this is what the Contract, in clear and unequivocal terms, provided.\n94 Beckhaus did not add 3% lime to all the material. The addition of 3% lime required about 4,953 tons of lime to be added and Master Macready observed that delivery dockets for the project indicated deliveries of only 328.86 tons of lime. Although the delivery dockets do not establish precisely how much lime was added (more lime than reflected in the dockets may have been used), the quantity must have been substantially less than 4,953 tons.\n95 As Beckhaus did not add 3% lime to all the material, it did not stabilise and condition the additional excavated borrow material as the Contract required. In other words, it did not establish that it did the work, the subject of Variation 17, in accordance with the Contract. Accordingly, in my view, it is not entitled to be paid, in accordance with the Contract, for the work it did in that connection. It follows, in my view, that the Master erred in upholding Beckhaus’ claim for Variation 17.\n96 My conclusion in this regard does not necessarily mean that Beckhaus will receive no value whatever for the work the subject of the claim for Variation 17. In assessing the elements necessary for both Beckhaus’ claims and the Council’s cross-claims, regard would have to be had to the degree to which the Variation 17 work advanced the due completion of the Contract. This will be a matter for Macready AsJ.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nVariation 21\n97 The parties made no oral submissions in relation to this variation but relied on their written submissions.\n98 As mentioned, Variation 21 is a claim by Beckhaus for its costs in holding its machinery in Brewarrina after it had claimed practical completion.\n99 As mentioned, on 18 March 2002, Beckhaus in writing requested the superintendent to issue a certificate of practical completion. In terms of cl 42.5 of the General Conditions, the superintendent was required, within 14 days of the receipt of Beckhaus’ request, to provide a certificate of practical completion “or give [Beckhaus] in writing the reasons for not issuing the certificate”.\n100 Master Macready accepted that the superintendent refused to issue a list of defects in the work to which Beckhaus could have responded or made decisions to remove its major earthmoving equipment.\n101 Beckhaus submitted to the Master that, under cl 42.5, the Council, within 14 days after receiving the request of 18 March 2004, should have given Beckhaus reasons advising it “of outstanding items required to be completed to achieve practical completion” and, had this been done, Beckhaus “could have made appropriate decisions to retain or demobilise its major earthmoving equipment from the site of its works at Brewarrina”. Beckhaus submitted further that, as Master Macready had found, the only valid reason for the superintendent not granting a certificate of practical completion “was a lack of a sufficient number of test results for the installation of culverts”. Beckhaus submitted that, accordingly, the Council “has substantially failed in its cross-claim in these proceedings and hence there was no requirement for [Beckhaus] to have kept its major earthmoving equipment on site”.\n102 The Master agreed with the submissions of Beckhaus and found that it was reasonable for Beckhaus to have kept its equipment on site until 27 April 2002 and that it was entitled to the costs of doing so. The reasons do not reveal from what date those costs were incurred and how they were made up.\n103 For reasons that I set out below, I consider that the Master erred in finding that the only reason for not issuing a certificate of practical completion was the lack of a sufficient number of test results for the culverts. In my opinion, Beckhaus breached the Contract by failing to achieve the required degree of compaction over and in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and, also, by failing to achieve a uniform factor of 12% linear shrinkage in respect of the levees it constructed. These breaches may well give rise to rectification costs of a not insubstantial amount. Were that to be the case, it would not be correct that the Council substantially failed in its cross-claim. Accordingly, the foundation for the Master’s decision in regard to Variation 21 would fall away.\n104 The Council contended that the claim for Variation 21 should fail because it was premised on practical completion having been achieved, and the Master had held that it was not achieved. While I accept (albeit for different reasons, being the breaches of contract to which I have referred) that practical completion was not achieved, I do not think that fact is necessarily an answer to the claim for Variation 21.\n105 From my reading of the written arguments, Beckhaus’ claim is not based on the argument that practical completion was achieved; rather it is based on the asserted failure of the superintendent to provide adequate reasons for not issuing a certificate of practical completion in accordance with cl 42.5 of the General Conditions. Looked at in this way, the claim is a claim for damages for breach of contract, rather than a claim for a variation.\n106 The parties’ written arguments on this issue were premised on matters that, by reason of the finding that the Contract was terminated, have altered significantly. In the circumstances, I am reluctant to attempt to resolve the claim on the material before this Court. I would remit this claim to Macready AsJ for determination in the light of these reasons.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 16 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe culverts\n107 I now turn to those aspects of Master Macready’s judgment in regard to the cross-claim in respect of which the Council appeals.\n108 The first finding of the Master that the Council challenged was that, despite the Master’s conclusion that Beckhaus had not complied with the specification in regard to the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts, there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts and in their immediate vicinity.\n109 There were 13 culverts in the levees Beckhaus constructed. The levees were not of a uniform height but, in parts of the levee, for example, the height was to be 1650 millimetres made up of compacted 150 millimetre thick layers. The culverts themselves were 600 millimetres deep. The expert witnesses identified the culverts as parts of the levees that were particularly susceptible to erosion.\n110 Unlike the rest of the levees, the soil in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and up to a certain level over the culverts could not be compacted by using heavy machinery. It was feared that the weight of heavy machinery might damage the culverts.\n111 Clause 3.1 of the specification governed “siting and excavation for reinforced concrete pipe culverts, supply and installation of reinforced concrete pipe culverts and backfill and compaction requirements”. Clause 3.7 provided:\n\n“Unless directed otherwise by the superintendent, all material shall be compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness.”\n\nClause 3.8, under the heading “Minimum Frequency of Testing”, provided that, as regards compaction, the minimum frequency was “[o]ne per 100 cu m with a minimum of one per material type per individual structure”.\n112 Clause 8.9.3 of the specification provided:\n\n“For the purposes of compaction control the following test frequencies shall be adopted as a minimum: -\n(a) …\n(b) For backfill of Discharge Pipes and Stormwater Drainage Pipes: 1 test per layer.”\n\nAccordingly, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be carried out (a “layer” being 150 millimetres thick).\n113 Beckhaus submitted that there was a conflict between cl 3.8 and cl 8.9.3, and submitted that cl 3.8 was paramount as it was more specific. As Hodgson JA pointed out in the course of argument, however, there is no conflict; the Contract simply provided for two different minimum standards and both had to be complied with. That is to say, under cl 3.8 one test had to be undertaken per 100 cu m “with minimum of one per material type of individual structure” and, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be undertaken.\n114 In fact, no tests were undertaken in regard to five culverts; one or no tests were taken in respect of three culverts; two culverts were tested only once each; there was one culvert in respect of which two tests were undertaken; there were two culverts in respect of each of which seven to eight tests were undertaken.\n115 In August 2003 two tests, known as the “Golder tests” were undertaken at two culverts. Master Macready said in regard to these tests:\n\n“They indicated that at a depth of .15 that the field dry density was 95% and a depth of 1.2 was 90.5%.”\n\nThus, one passed and the other did not (but only at the depths indicated).\n116 The Master described the relevant evidence being that set out in Beckhaus’ submissions as follows:\n\n“Komp, the Superintendent under the contract during construction, witnessed compaction occurring at culvert locations … He was not challenged on this evidence under cross examination;\nThe daily records of [Beckhaus] support that compaction occurred at culverts … ;\nMacartney’s evidence is that compaction was carried out at culverts … ;\nWhilst Macartney under cross examination admitted that the specified number of compaction tests was not taken at culvert locations …, his evidence that compaction was actually performed at culverts was not seriously challenged …\nTest results taken by CETS at culvert locations confirm that compaction was satisfactory ….”\n117 The Master then concluded:\n\n“The fact that sufficient tests were not taken at the culverts as appears from Mr Macartney’s evidence precludes me from coming to a conclusion that there has been compliance with the specification requirements for the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts. However, the evidence before me clearly demonstrates that there has been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts.”", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nLinear shrinkage\n142 Clause 8.7.1 of the specification provided:\n\n“The levee embankment and Key Trench shall be constructed of Zone A Clayfill material, being clayey material selectively won from the borrow area or existing northern or southern Levees and having a maximum linear shrinkage value of 12%.”\n143 Linear shrinkage is a measure, by a theoretical test, of the amount that a soil “shrinks” when the moisture is removed from it. In the theoretical test, the soil sample is put in an oven and all the moisture is removed.\n144 The Master said:\n\n“It is perfectly obvious from the evidence given in the case that the purpose of having achieved a particular linear shrinkage was to reduce the likelihood of deep and wide cracking in the embankment which might allow initiation of internal erosion and piping failure under flood conditions.”\n145 Erosion is a physical process whereby the action of wind or water washes or carries away the soil particles. Piping is a process that occurs when water passes through a levee bank by way of a crack or internal seepage; water erodes the soil and a “pipe” is formed through the levee.\n146 The Contract required testing of linear shrinkage. These tests were carried out by CETS. I have referred to CETS’ practice not to issue failing certificates and to alert Beckhaus if they believed the soil was such that a test might fail. Thus, each of the tests of linear shrinkage required by the Contract passed.\n147 In addition to the CETS tests, some tests were conducted on 24 October 2001 by K & H Construction Services Pty Ltd. The Master said in regard to these tests:\n\n“These tests were conducted only for linear shrinkage at the request of Mr Komp, the superintendent. The actual test results which were taken at six places showed results ranging from 14% to 18%. These results were conveyed to [Beckhaus] and as a result the areas were reworked with additional lime being added. It is clear from Mr Komp’s evidence that this rework was in respect of the area which had been tested and found wanting. Mr Komp did not have any further check tests done and, accordingly, throughout the rest of the construction, the testing by CETS showed that the results achieved the required level of 12%.”\n148 Later, after Beckhaus had left the site, further tests were carried out for linear shrinkage. On 2 and 3 April 2002 an organisation known as Barnson conducted 13 linear shrinkage tests, 12 of which failed with a range between 14% and 18.5%. The one test that passed was located in the northern levee. Three other tests at the northern levee, however, indicated linear shrinkage results of between 14% and 16%. The nine other failed tests carried out by Barnson were undertaken at the Tarrion Creek, Charlton Road, southern and North Brewarrina levees. In fact, during April to July 2003, Barnson carried out 36 linear shrinkage tests and 20 of these failed, including some in the northern levee.\n149 In April 2002 Douglas Partners conducted 10 further linear shrinkage tests. Five failed, with a range of 14.5% to 18.5%. The failures were in regard to tests taken in the Charlton Road levee, the Tarrion Creek levee, the southern levee, the northern levee (where one failed and three passed) and one in the North Brewarrina levee.\n150 In September 2003 Golder undertook 12 linear shrinkage tests, 6 of which failed with ranges from 12.5% to 18.%. One of the failures was in the northern levee.\n151 Master Macready dealt with these tests as follows:\n\n“It is perfectly plain that the results indicate a variety of failures and a variety of occasions when the specifications were met.”\n\nHe observed further:\n“There was no suggestion that the linear shrinkage factor varied over time.”\n\nAnd said:\n“Given the existence of these failures [in testing] it is hard to conclude that there has not been some breach of the specifications.”\n152 The Master then turned to the question whether the breaches would have any “important” effect. I think that what he meant by that was whether the breaches resulted in the Council sustaining damage. The Master expressed his conclusion on this question as follows:\n\n“Bearing in mind my conclusion that there has not been demonstrated a sufficient departure from the compaction requirement it seems to me that there has been substantial compliance with the contract in respect of linear shrinkage. This flows from the fact that such testing as there is, seems to indicate a compliance in the northern levee which is agreed to be sufficient. In respect of the other levees the evidence is of little weight because there is no basis expressed for the conclusions reached. In particular I am satisfied that in respect of linear shrinkage the levees are fit for their intended purpose.”\n153 I would observe that it is not to the point that the levees might be fit for their intended purpose. The correct question is whether, in consequence of the breaches of contract, the Council has suffered damage.\n154 The Master’s reference to the tests seeming to “indicate a compliance in the northern levee which is agreed to be sufficient” was based on evidence given by Dr Truscott, an expert called on behalf of the Council, and Dr Burman, an expert called on behalf of Beckhaus. The Master noted that Dr Truscott, when shown the test results from Barnson in respect of the northern levee (on which there was substantial compliance), stated that he had “no problem with the northern levee in terms of linear shrinkage”. Dr Burman testified that there was probably “substantial compliance to [sic – in] the northern levee”.\n155 Master Macready’s observation that, in respect of the other levees, the evidence was of little weight was based on the following observation he made:\n\n“In respect of the other levees such results as they are show a different picture [from the northern levee] indicative of 12% not having been achieved for the majority of cases. However, whether such results given their small number are sufficient to lead one to conclude that the whole of the levees do not meet the specification depends upon whether one can extrapolate such a result from a small number of tests. There is nothing in the [Council’s] expert’s material that deals with this and it would seem that this is a flaw in their evidence which would lead me to give it little weight.”\n156 The Master, having found that there had been a variety of failures and a variety of occasions when the specified tests were not met, said that the question to be asked was “whether or not one can extrapolate any result across the whole levee in respect of these results”. He found that the tests were insufficient in number to draw any inference as to shrinkage over an area greater than the specific areas where the failed tests were conducted.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

Despite the price, the Mavic Air 2 is infinitely easier to fly - with more bells and whistles than your cheapo micro drones! The remote controller feels really intuitive to use, and feels nice to hold. You don’t need to worry about unfolding or properly aiming antennas since they’re built into the controller and phone holder. \n\nI’m amazed on the reported range on this thing - on the 2nd day of owning the drone I had it flying a mile away from my house, and that’s not even close to the max transmission range it is capable of. The return to home (RTH) feature works like a charm, and returns the drones to the exact position I took off from - simply amazing. \n\n4K video from a small portable device like this is amazing, and the 48mp camera takes outstanding pictures.\n\nCustomer Review 2: Incredible.\n\nIf I could give it 6 stars, I would. Perfect is not an exaggeration here. I constantly tell people that it's the best thousand bucks I've ever spent. You can't possibly know how much fun you'll have with this thing unless you've owned a drone before. The camera quality is simply stunning and I attached a screenshot of unedited footage as an example. The only drawback for me is that it doesn't have obstacle avoidance sensors on the top and the sides like the Mavic Pro II, but the Pro II is also 700 more dollars. So if that's what I have to give up to save 700 bucks, then so be it. I will stress one thing, make SURE to get some kind of insurance coverage for it. Because there's nothing that feels quite like watching a thousand bucks fly off into the sunset never to be seen again. For the record, that was due to pilot error and happened with the original Mavic Air, not the Air 2, but I digress. Buy the DJI care refresh package as well, your future self will thank you for it. And I also bought a State Farm policy for the whole year for just 60 bucks. That protects me against loss or theft which the DJI plan does not. Now dig out those 10 or 11 Benjamins and go have some fun!\n\nCustomer Review 3: One of the best Drone\n\nAs a first time drone buyer I had my doubts if I should go for mavic 2 and spend 900 dollars at the risk of doing something wrong and Damaging the drone but I’m glad I bought it the interface is so easy and smooth even for the beginners, In no time I was able to get my drone in air and was able to shoot beautiful videos and pictures , really pleased w the performance and the ease of handling , this is an awesome product.", "answer": "Hello!

{"prompt": "", "input": "[Markdown]\n## Assignment\nWe will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n[Code] \nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# business\\_id (150346, object, ym3e\\_a1L4gyKZWU1-LuRYQ)\n# name (150346, object, J J Gandy's Pies)\n# address (150346, object, 5703 W Smith Valley Rd)\n# city (150346, object, Tampa)\n# state (150346, object, TN)\n# postal\\_code (150346, object, 46227)\n# latitude (150346, float64, 43.5939441)\n# longitude (150346, float64, -86.2621502)\n# stars (150346, float64, 4.5)\n# review\\_count (150346, int64, 21)\n# is\\_open (150346, int64, 1)\n# attributes (136602, object, {'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'})\n# categories (150243, object, Pizza, Restaurants, Food)\n# hours (127123, object, {'Monday': '12:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-0:0', 'Friday': '12:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-0:0'})\n\n[Markdown]\n# Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n## Initial Questions\n\n1.

A PC Item includes the cost of the supply of the item only.\n\nUnder Clause 11 of the Contract, PC Items exclude the cost of delivery to site, installation, fixing, supervision, overhead and profit, which must all be included in the Contract price. PC Items must be listed in the Schedule of Particulars at Item 10(b).\n\nI want you to remember this as part of our conversation. Do you understand?", "answer": "Yes, I understand.

{"prompt": "", "input": "Further to your own knowledge, I want you to consider the following information on When does a prime cost become a variation?\n\nGenerally, a major change to the nature and extent of a PC item is more than an adjustment and in these circumstances a variation is needed.\n\nExample: If the owner decided to change the PC described as an ‘electric cooktop' to a ‘gas cooktop' (which included the laying of gas lines and certification of gas installation), then this is no longer something that can be calculated as a PC. It is a variation. The calculation would now include the price of the new cook top plus any installation costs less the PC allowance.\n\nPCs are not normally treated as variations. The adjustment calculation should be prepared on an invoice that is to be paid in accordance with Clause 17.6. However, there are exceptions as detailed below.\n\nThe calculation is set out in Clause 17.4 and 17.5 of the contract which provides that:\n\n‘'17.4 If the actual price is less than the prime cost item allowance, the difference is deducted from the contract price” and “17.5 If the actual price is more than the prime cost item allowance, the total difference and the builder's margin allowance applied to that difference is added to the contract price.” Example: If the allowance in Attachment D is $1100 (including GST) and the builder's margin is 20% under the contract.\n\nI want you to remember this as part of our conversation.

If you understand my request, please reply by only saying \"acknowledged\".\n\nWhether Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy are “persons” for the purposes of s 37\n\nAlternatively, Mr Campbell submitted that Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy are not “persons” for the purposes of s 37 of the Act.\n\nNeither Mr Boulus nor Mr McCarthy is currently a party to the proceedings. Mr Campbell did not appear for Mr McCarthy. Mr Campbell did not dispute that the Builder itself is a “person” for the purposes of s 37 of the Act.\n\nIn Pafburn, I held that a person “having substantive control over the carrying out of any work” for the purpose of cl (d) of the definition of “construction work” in s 36(1) of the Act included a person able to control how the work was carried out.\n\nIn the proposed Technology and Construction Cross-Claim List Statement, the Council alleges that Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy were both able to, and in fact did, exercise control over the carrying out of the building work.\n\nThus, it is alleged that:\n\n“ … [i]n his capacity as the managing director of [the Builder], [Mr Boulus] had the power and ability to and did substantively control all of the building works comprising the entire project, such control including the appointment and control of the project delivery staff working for [the Builder] (including the appointment and control of [Mr McCarthy]), the supervision of the adequacy of the works performed by such project delivery staff, the selection and appointment of subcontractors to perform elements of the Works for which [the Builder] was ultimately responsible, and the overall supervision and acceptance of the works performed by [the Builder’s] employees and subcontractors, for the ultimate benefit of [the Council]. Further, as the managing director of [the Builder], [Mr Boulus] had the ultimate ability to control how the Works performed by [the Builder] were carried out.”\n\nIn relation to Mr McCarthy, it is alleged:\n\n“As the site supervisor for the Project, [Mr McCarthy] actively supervised, coordinated and project managed all of the primary elements of the building works comprising the project, and coordinated and directed how the Works performed by [the Builder] were carried out, including by directing and engaging with [the Builder’s] subcontractors in the performance of their works.”\n\nMr Campbell pointed to the potentially wide-ranging consequences of construing “persons” in s 37 to cover a director of a builder, such as Mr Boulus, or an employee of a builder, such as Mr McCarthy.\n\nThus, Mr Campbell submitted:\n\n“Every person on a construction site has substantive control or supervision over some building work performed at that site, often the work that they themselves directly perform, and accordingly, taking section 37 at its broadest interpretation, every such person could potentially come within the ambit of a ‘person who carries out construction work’, and be the subject of an automatic statutory duty of care to the current and future owners of a project where no such duty previously existed. Such a broad interpretation could make hundreds, or on a very large job even thousands, of people personally liable in respect of the construction work over which they have control or supervision, which would have far reaching and negative impacts on the construction industry.\n\nWhen one considers the fact that construction cases often involve claims for hundreds of defects, which may involve the work of multiple subcontractors, consultants, and supervisors in addition to employees and officers of the builder, a broad interpretation of section 37 would also result in building cases that balloon to include huge numbers of defendants, increasing the cost and complexity of what is already a costly and complex area of litigation. This is especially so when one considers the potential for the defence of proportionate liability that can be pleaded in defence of a claim under [the Act] to raise the same issues of liability of multiple third parties even if the plaintiff does not join all potential defendants to their claim.” (Emphasis in original.)\n\nIn those circumstances, Mr Campbell submitted that “persons” should be construed more narrowly.\n\nMr Campbell submitted that the reference in s 37 to a “person” who carries out “construction work”, when read with the definition of “construction work” in s 36, is:\n\n“… obviously intended to refer to more than just a builder, and by reference to their function encompasses roles such as the architect, the project manager, the design consultants and possibly sub-contractors…”.\n\nMr Campbell submitted that “person” should be construed as “a person who carries out construction work in their own capacity”, and as not including a person who acts as agent for another.\n\nIn the Second Reading Speech [15] delivered by the Minister on introduction of the Design and Building Practitioners Bill 2019, the Minister said that the Bill was designed “to introduce a suite of new obligations on design and building practitioners to ensure that each step of construction is well documented and compliant”. The Minister continued that the Bill introduces “a number of new requirements, which will ensure that key practitioners are held accountable for their work across planning, design and construction stages.”", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 7 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. Do not write anything for now. If you understand my request, please reply by only saying \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe Minister also said, speaking of the clause in the Bill that became s 37 of the Act:\n\n“For the first time in New South Wales, [s 37] establishes a statutory duty of care that eradicates any uncertainty that may exist in the common law that a duty is owed to the end user and in respect to liability for defective building work. Any person who carries out construction work will, under the provisions of the bill and for the first time, have an automatic duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid economic loss caused by defects in or related to a building for which the construction work is done or arising out of that work.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nAs the Minister, here, did no more than recite the language of the relevant clause, this passage casts no light on the question before me.\n\nThe “uncertainty” to which the Minister referred arose from the decision of the High Court in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288. [16] In that case, the Court found that, in the particular circumstances before it, the owners corporation could not maintain a claim in negligence against the builder as successor in title to the developer. It is true, as Mr Campbell submitted, that the case was not concerned with the owners corporation’s claim against directors and employees of the builder but rather whether any action lay against the builder at all. However, I do not see what light that casts on the question of whether “owner” in s 37 extends to such directors and employees.\n\nUltimately, the question as to the meaning to be given to “person” in the expression in s 37 “a person who carries out construction work” requires that careful attention be paid to the words used in the Act.\n\nThe Act deals with the obligations and registration of the “practitioners” to which the Minister referred.\n\n“Practitioner” is defined in the Act to mean:\n\n“… a design practitioner, principal design practitioner, professional engineer, specialist practitioner or building practitioner.”\n\nEach of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act.\n\nA “design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who prepares regulated designs”. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of design practitioners” including the making of “design compliance declaration[s]” [19] or “further design compliance declaration[s]”. \n\nA “principal design practitioner” is defined to be a “person who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner”. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of principal design practitioners”. The Act provides that “a person must not make a principal compliance declaration” unless that “person” is a “registered principal design practitioner” under the Act.\n\nA “professional engineer” is defined to mean “a person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32”, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a “person” must not carry out professional engineering work unless that “person” is a “registered professional engineer” under the Act.\n\nA “specialist practitioner” is defined to mean “a person who carries out specialist work” [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, “the design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element”. [27] Such a “person” must not carry out specialist work unless that “person” is a “registered specialist practitioner” under the Act.\n\nA “building practitioner” is defined to be “a person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work” or “if more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work”. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the “obligations of building practitioners”.\n\nThere is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 8 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. Do not write anything for now. If you understand my request, please reply by only saying \"acknowledged\".\n\n“Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate.\n\nIn the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described.\n\nThere are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”.\n\nFor example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act.\n\nThus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not.\n\nIn the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care.\n\nThus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”.\n\nThe references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”.\n\nAs I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is:\n\n“construction work means any of the following—\n\n(a) building work,\n\n(b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work,\n\n(c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work,\n\n(d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.)\n\nThe definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake.\n\nThe definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake.\n\nThe definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself.\n\nFinally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”.\n\nThe potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is part 9 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. Do not write anything for now. If you understand my request, please reply by only saying \"acknowledged\".\n\nIt is true, as Mr Campbell pointed out, that the Minister, referring to the provisions in the Bill that became ss 39 and 40 of the Act, [32] said:\n\n“The bill continues to safeguard the rights of owners through [ss 39 and 40] by preventing a person who performs construction work from delegating or contracting of their duty.\n\nThis is important, as practitioners will need to accept individual and collective responsibility for their work.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nMr Campbell submitted that the Minister’s reference in this passage to “practitioners” rather than “persons” suggests that Parliament’s intention was that s 37 “was intended to apply primarily to practitioners”. That may be so. But the fact is that the word used in s 37(1) is “person”, not “practitioner”.\n\nThe Act is expressed to be subject to the Civil Liability Act. [33] The proportionate liability regime under Pt 4 of the Civil Liability Act thus applies to actions for breach of the s 37 statutory duty. This enables persons in the position of Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy to identify concurrent wrongdoers and seek to have their liability for breach of the statutory duty limited under s 35 of the Civil Liability Act. This appears to be the means by which Parliament has sought to address the matters to which Mr Campbell referred, as set out at [30] above.\n\nAccordingly, I do not see the Council’s proposed identification of Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy as “persons” for the purposes of s 37 of the Act to be a reason to refuse it leave to make the amendments sought.\n\n“Conflict of laws”\n\nMr Campbell also submitted that “the automatic duty owed by directors of building companies is relevantly in conflict with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and in particular sections 119, 124 and 516 and the definition of ‘a company limited by shares’ in section 9”. Those sections deal with the questions of when a company comes into existence (s 119), the legal capacity and powers of the company (s 124) and the obligations of contributories in a company limited by shares (s 516). I am unable to see what relevance those sections have to the issues here.\n\nMr Campbell also submitted that the imposition on “company directors” of the “automatic duty” under s 37 “is contrary to the independence of a corporation from its directors and members, a central [tenet] of corporations legislation”. Mr Campbell did not develop that submission. I do not see how s 37 has any such consequence. The duty imposed on a director of the company who engages in “construction work” by s 37 is the same duty as is imposed on the company itself.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

{"prompt": "", "input": "add this please\n\nSTART\n\nExposure\n\nThe exposure triangle consists of three fundamental components of exposure in photography: Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO. Adjusting any one of these settings will impact the other two, so understanding how to use them to achieve the desired exposure is crucial.\n\nTips:\n- Aperture: a lower f-stop value will give you a wider aperture (more light), while a higher f-stop value will give you a narrower aperture (less light).\n- Shutter Speed: slower shutter speeds will allow more light into the camera, while faster shutter speeds will allow less light into the camera.\n- ISO: a lower ISO setting will result in less digital noise, while a higher ISO setting will result in more digital noise.\n\nA well-balanced exposure will have the correct brightness, contrast, and level of detail.\n\nEND", "answer": "Got it! I have added your note to my storage."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "add this please:\n\nSTART\n\nShutter Speed\n\nA faster shutter speed is typically used to freeze motion and capture sharp images, while a slower shutter speed can be used to create blur and convey a sense of movement or motion.\n\nReciprocal Rule\nThe reciprocal rule states that the shutter speed should be set to at least the same number as the lens focal length to avoid camera shake and motion blur (e.g. if using a 50mm lens, the shutter speed should be set to at least 1/50th of a second).\n\nEND", "answer": "Noted!

{"prompt": "", "input": "add please:\n\nSTART\n\nf-stop\nThe f-stop is a measurement of the aperture opening on a camera lens, which controls the amount of light that enters the camera. The f-stop is expressed as a ratio of the lens's focal length to the diameter of the aperture opening.\n\nA lower f-stop value (such as f/2.8) means a larger aperture opening, which lets in more light and results in a shallower depth of field (meaning the area in focus will be smaller). A higher f-stop value (such as f/16) means a smaller aperture opening, which lets in less light and results in a deeper depth of field (meaning more of the image will be in focus).\n\nEND", "answer": "Noted!

Do not start providing assistance until the student asks you a question. If the student goes off topic, make sure to bring them back to the topic of the problem.\n\n--- START CONTEXT ---\n\\*\\*TITLE: 16.3 O notation\n\\*\\*LESSON (USE THIS AS A BASIS FOR YOUR RESPONSES TO THE STUDENT):\nBig O notation\nBig O notation is a mathematical way of describing how a function (running time, or runtime, of an algorithm) behaves in relation to the input size. In Big O notation, all functions that have the same growth rate (as determined by the highest order term) are characterized using the same Big O notation. In essence, all functions that have the same growth rate are considered equivalent in Big O notation.\n\nGiven a function that describes the runtime of an algorithm, the Big O notation for that function can be determined using the following rules:\n\n1. If f(x) is a sum of several terms, the highest order term (the one with the fastest growth rate) is kept and others are discarded.\n2. If f(x) has a term that is a product of several factors, all constants (those that are not in terms of x) are omitted.\n\n16.3.1: Determining Big O notation of a function.\n1. Determine a function that describes the runtime of the algorithm, and then compute the Big O notation of that function.\n2. Apply rules to obtain the Big O notation of the function.\n3. All functions with the same growth rate are considered equivalent in Big O notation.\n\n\\*\\*PROBLEM:\nWhich of the following Big O notations is equivalent to O(N+9999)?\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 1: O(1)\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 1 EXPLANATION: Incorrect. Only the highest order term is kept. For O(N+9999), N is the highest order term.\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 2: O(N)\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 2 EXPLANATION: Correct. For O(N+9999), N is the highest order term, yielding O(N).\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 3: O(9999)\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 3 EXPLANATION: Incorrect. 9999 is not the highest order term and is discarded. N is the highest order term.\n--- END CONTEXT ---", "answer": "Hello! I'm here to help you with your question.

{"prompt": "", "input": "Since you introduced the tono pad, there are ampoules too. Can you introduce the ampoules too?\nThe ampoule products are based on vegan certification. We developed a green pound line and a moisture line. For the green line, we used a component called Houttuynia cordata to focus on calming. For voicecher, we used cypress water.\nI used ingredients that can moisturize and moisturize at the same time. I got grade ewg for both products. I also got 8 ingredients for reconciliation certification and no additives. And then there are some exfoliating ingredients. Yes, we removed all of them.\nI only made neutral emplos.\nBut I'm curious after hearing what you said. Then, you can't exfoliate.\nIf you want to exfoliate, there are different types of ampoules, so the role of ampoules is to get help from calculating something by using this skin. So we decided that it's better to focus on one thing rather than collecting a lot of things. So, there's a soothing line and we're going to continue to derive it like this.\nRight now, you can say that it's a part that lowers the irritation by taking out those ingredients.\nYes, yes. Then should I say that it's kind of the difference between Ad-Mang brands?\nIf there's something like this, can you introduce what you're choosing?\nWe focus on communicating with consumers first. When we developed the Tove Pad, we tried to focus on the conditions that fit our skin rather than following the trend.\nIn the case of ampoules, we've been certified as ewg and vegan. So if the point is that we put a lot of things in other parts at once, we'll focus on one thing.\nAlthough the effect will be a little late. Yes, the exact effect of one thing is that it's differentiated.\nEach function is completely specialized like this.\nThat's what you're talking about. Do you have any history of winning awards or attracting investment?\nNo, we're...\nNot yet. Yes, yes. In the future, when you develop products,\nI'm asking you about what kind of process you're going through, or what's unusual, but is it okay if I ask you what you're considering especially when you develop a new product?\nIf I'm a bit out of it, in the process of developing other products,\nThe difference in the process is that we actually send samples to consumers and test them ourselves, and based on that feedback, the product is being released through all the sampling conversions, so consumers and our brand want to find the best contact point and make the best product.\nAll right.\nAs I said, I think one of the important points is that we don't compromise.\nWhat I felt while making ampoule this time is that if there's a lot of purified water, the price of ampoule goes down a lot.\nBut we don't use any Jang Jae Soo anymore.\nBecause of that, compared to other ampoule costs, it has a much higher cost.\nIn that direction, I'm thinking about planning it so that I don't use other new products and take all the necessary things that customers really like.\nThen, could you introduce a case where there is a change in the release time by modifying this part of the existing product after hearing from the consumer?\nwhat\nIn the process of sending and testing samples for 3 months on the target date of release, people are now in this condition for their skin type, whether it's sticky or seasonal. Yes, I hope to use something in this case.\nI hope it feels like this. There are a lot of these ingredients that are in trend, but those ingredients don't fit me, so all those ingredients have been improved.\nMarketing and advertising are important to attract customers, so if you have any unique strategies, please let us know.\nWhen it comes to marketing strategies, we're using a marketing strategy that uses creators. So Craters can introduce the products to subscribers more confidently, and those subscribers can feel that it's so nice that Crater introduces these products.\nI think that's very important.\nSo, I pay attention to the quality that I mentioned earlier, so our first strategy is to approach crater subscribers well. And we're doing everything else.\nIt's not that we don't do anything about marketing. We have to do everything in all directions. But now, we're going to be closer to subscribers.\nI want to be a brand.\n\n\"NO.3\"", "answer": "Understand NO.3"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "You're trying to reach out to the subscribers as much as possible. Then what I'm curious about is that if you collaborate with a creator, Admant can show the product to more customers, and it's good because customers know products that they didn't know, so what's good about this collaboration?\nAs we said before, it comes out in a tri-high quality, so I think that's very important for creators.\nWhen I introduce a specific product to my subscribers, they have to be satisfied with the product after using it.\nIf this satisfaction doesn't come true anymore, you can lose your trust when you introduce something.\nSo we're going to keep suggesting points that can give you trust, so if creators are with us, I think there's a value that can give those subscribers trust and value.\nThe main sales channels right now are located in d2c and open markets.\nThere's also a market. Until now, the smart store was the main, and Coupang was the second channel. Now, we're thinking about playing with assets while making our own mall.\nThen how long has it been since you opened your own mall?\nWe just opened it. Yes, I opened it with \"NE\" during the live.\nThree weeks.\nYou said that you're going to eventually go to the company mall and eventually go to the channel. What's the reason?\nI think there's a strong point of selling at our company because when consumers buy from our company, they become our customers.\nIf you go through other platforms, they're not actually our customers, they're our customers, and there are people who buy our products.\nThat's right. That's why we're going to create our customers and give them more customized cs.\nI think the customized benefits will be strengthened. I think the repurchase rate and things like that will help our sales a lot.\nWhenever I hear this, it's a bit embarrassing to ask, but is there any of the B2C malls that you can find on our cafe platform?\nYes, please use it.\nWhat's the reason?\nWe thought about other things, but I think Cafe 24 has the longest experience and has the most functions. And I think Cafe 24 has the fastest and best way to see you off, so we chose it.\nThank you.\nThank you at the hospital.\nYes, then next... Then they're not doing it offline yet, but they're doing it online.\nYes, there is no offline side right now. Our brand power is still...\nIt's short. Yes, then I want to ask you how you're overcoming any difficulties in the business management process.\nActually, right now, we...\nIf there's anything you've been focusing on lately,\nWe're running our own mall right now.\nIn the past, what we were good at was playing in the open market or running around first, but these days, I've been thinking that the company's play is very important when we make this brand.\nIn fact, we are focusing a little on making our customers and developing this brand.\nIf we used the platform's power to create cash flows before this, we're thinking of focusing on increasing our brand value.\nAh.\nThen I'm curious about this. Aram and I did a live commerce broadcast on our company mall.\nNow, the connection is slightly cut off, but after that, has the level of idle and visitors changed a little?\nTell us about your company mall. Yes, our company mall started with live life, so we're trying to play a lot on the ground.\nAre you judging that it will continue to flow in after that's what you're thinking? All right.\nIt's working and sales are happening little by little.\nI think our task is to increase the proportion.\nThen what kind of long-term goal is this Ad-Mang brand pursuing?

{"prompt": "", "input": "Read the following text describing some enzymatic reactions: \"Confirmation of Act-designed pathways: We chose to validate Act designs by implementing the pathway shown in Figure 3 for 4-acetaminophen. This L2 pathway branched off from chorismate biosynthesis and was unnatural in two regards. First, it suggested a gene from the common mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) for conversion of PABA to 4-aminophenol for the penultimate step. Second, it suggested using 4-aminophenol as an unnatural substrate for the E. coli gene N-\n27\nhydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase (NhoA). The enzyme’s natural substrate is p- aminobenzoic acid but it has also been shown to acetylates 4-aminophenol to produce acetaminophen [8]. The pathway is shown in Figure 3.\nThe enzymes 4ABH and NhoA were synthesized or PCRed from source material and cloned into a p15A vector with constitutive expression. The pabABC genes were assembled into an operon without a promoter and cloned into a high copy vector. As acetaminophen is a biologically active molecule in humans, we performed all experiments in dapD knockout strains that are unable to colonize the human gut.\nThe in vivo activity of the individual enzymes were confirmed by feeding in 10mM of precursors p-aminobenzoic acid or 4-aminophenol and using LCMS to confirm the 1-step transformations (p-aminobenzoic acid to 4-aminophenol and 4-aminophenol to acetaminophen, respectively). 4-aminophenol was detected via LCMS when p-aminobenzoic acid was fed to cells overexpressing 4ABH, and acetaminophen was detected via LCMS when 4-aminophenol was fed to cells overexpressing NhoA. The 2-step pathway was then confirmed by supplementing the media with 1 mM p-aminobenzoic acid and observing the production of acetaminophen. Finally, cells with the 4ABH, NhoA, and pabABC constructs were grown in glycerol minimal media to relieve product inhibition of the chorismate pathway and a yield of 2.9 μM was measured via LCMS. No further optimization was attempted to improve the yield. The experimental confirmation of the acetaminophen pathway demonstrates how novel biosynthesis routes can be designed by computational algorithms and highlights the need for more formalizable biochemical data.\"\n\nThis text describes the structured data:\n{\n\"enzyme\" : \"4ABH\",\n\"substrate\" : \"p-aminobenzoic acid\",\n\"product\" : \"4-aminophenol\"\n}\n\nWhat other similarly-structured data can you infer from the text?", "answer": "{\n\"enzyme\" : \"NhoA\",\n\"substrate\" : \"4-aminophenol\",\n\"product\" : \"acetaminophen\"\n}"}

{"prompt": "", "input": "video #4 - Cross-cutting concerns in React\n\nWhen building React applications, you will find yourself creating some generic functionality that is not related to the applications business logic and that is needed in many places. For example, think about managing different permission roles, handling errors, or even logging. They are all required for any application, but are not necessary from the business point of view. This group of functionality is what falls into the category of cross-cutting concerns. In this video you are going to learn about cross-cutting concerns and why components despite being the primary unit of code reuse in React aren't always a good choice for this kind of logic. You will also discover why new patterns were introduced to solve this problem. Excited to learn more, well, let's get started. Imagine that you are tasked with building the logic to display a list of live orders for the little lemon restaurant app. Let's explore how this could be achieved. Here is a valid implementation for a live orders list where local state is used for storing the current list of orders and use effect handles both the subscription and on subscription to the live data updating the order's value as soon as a new order arrives. Now, imagine the little lemon also needs a place in the application to keep track of the number of users subscribing to its newsletter in real-time. This could be a valid implementation for such functionality. Can you identify any similarities between live orders list and newsletter list? They are definitely not identical since they call different methods on data source and render a different output, but much of the implementation is the same. Upon examination, they both add a change listener to data source on mount, set new state whenever the data source changes and remove the change listener on unmount. You can imagine that in a large app the same pattern of subscribing to data source and setting local state with new data will occur over and over again. So far you have seen that our custom hook to encapsulate that logic is one of the solutions at your disposal, however, that introduces the issue of having to alter the implementation of each component that needs that data and thus making all of them stateful. How could you define the subscription logic in a single place? Share it across many components and keep them unchanged and stateless. Well, this is where higher-order components are a perfect solution. A higher-order component also known as a HOC is an advanced pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature. Specifically, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order components transforms a component into another component. In other words, it enhances or extends the capabilities of the component provided. Let's go ahead and examine how the implementation of this reusable subscription logic would look with a higher-order component. With subscription is the higher-order component that takes the raft component you would like to enhance with subscription capabilities as well as a selectData function to determine the type of data you are getting from the data source. In this case, either orders or users. With subscription then returns a new component that renders the provided component and supplies a new prop to it called data that will contain the most recent list of items from the data source of interest. It also passes other prompts through to the rapt component, which is a convention in HOCs. That's the implementation, but how about its usage? In this case you would define two different components configured with custom parameters, one for live orders and another for newsletter subscribers all without having to repeat the subscription implementation in either live orders and user list making this a much more efficient solution. There's still one more pattern for cross-cutting concerns that you will learn about soon called render prompts. Great. In this video, you have learned about cross-cutting concerns and why components are not always enough for reusing behavior. You also explored one alternative pattern to encapsulate common behavior in React applications which are higher-order components.", "answer": "In this video, the concept of cross-cutting concerns in React applications is discussed.

You will assess the level of intimacy between The\\_Gift\\_Giver and all the data inputs of The\\_recipient, and you will output gift idea categories and gift ideas that are relevant to the two people and to the occasion.\nI am providing the following instructions to you. You will follow these instructions and only these instructions. \n\nHere they are, sequentially, in steps:\n1) Understand the two people based on the inputs\nIn this step, you will get to know the two people involved. Based on the inputs, you will create a characterization of the relationship, the occasion, and the recipient.\n\nThis is a primary role to keep into account:\n[Relationship] relationship to the gift giver = Brother\n[Age] = Can range from 0 25-64 years old\n[Occasion] = Wedding\n[Occupation] = Lawyer\n[Hobbies] = Cars, karate movies, beer\n[Favorite\\_animals] = Pet golden retriever, owls\n[Other\\_interests] = The Office, action movies, relaxing, bbq\n[Traits] = Sociable, amicable, agreeable\n\n2) Create Gift Ideas Categories and Gift Ideas list relevant to each category\nNow that you understand the relationship, occasion, and who the recipient is, create gift ideas for the categories based on your complete understanding of the character and personality of the recipient and the characterization of the occasion and relationship. remember, you are a gift expert, so be sensitive to all the factors at play when choosing gift ideas. \n\nAgain, you must follow these rules. Reach each rule very carefully and do not skip anything.\n\nRules for the categories (Do’s and Don’ts): \n\nFor each category, please do not include specific product names, brand names, or retailers.\n\nFor each category, describe the category in a way that captures the essence of the gift idea without referring to any specific product, brand, or retailer.

Create 1 category for each data point. Keep creating categories the inputs are exhausted. Don’t leave out any data input points.\n\nThe next batch of categories will be based on your knowledge and personality profile of the The\\_recipient where you will combine different inputs in a logical way that makes sense. You can be creative.\n\nGuidelines for the gift ideas:\nAll gift ideas should be in the form of keywords.\nMake one gift idea for each type of gift\nDO NOT repeat gift ideas \nThe gift ideas must be physical products that can be bought online, such as from Amazon.com, and delivered in the form of a physical product.\n\nThe gift ideas must be relevant to the The\\_recipient (character, the occasion, and the relationship between the giver and recipient).

{"prompt": "", "input": "Now in the next session for the first time, while the children were learning with devices which were only of the output type category whether LED is an output type device, a buzzer is also output type device and even a 7 segment. In this session, they actually get a chance to correct a device which is an ultrasonic sensor which is an input device which they will be using for the very first time. While they still follow the same pattern of having a clear objective about the session, then they get the knowledge of what is an ultrasonic sensor, what is ultrasound and how it works and all that with the help of a video and some knowledge and then they get the video to connect the ultrasonic sensor. They use a minimum of ultrasonic sensor which is a distance sensor and the tricolour LED as a combination and then at a diamond shape level the blockly blocks are enabled and they are able to create a program wherein the distance according to the distance the light of the tricolour LED is actually programmed and eventually at the end of the session some multiple choice questions as usual is being asked. So now the difference is that after these many sessions the children have now learned how to use an input device and get a response in an output device like LED based on the programming logic and this is where their learning experience actually goes to the next level. Just to continue here in the next session they go ahead and use the same ultrasonic sensor and then connect a buzzer, the tricolour LED and 7 segment all together and try to create various program like if I keep my hand between distance 10 to 20 centimetres then the ultrasonic sensor actually shows a number between 1 to 2 means it keeps jumping between 1 to 2 and then if it is between 2 to 3 then it keeps jumping and that's the way they are able to build a logic wherein the colour and the buzzer actually indicate something based on the logic. So their fun actually goes to the next level because they are able to integrate the previous components and also enjoy an input device based output response that too on their own programming logic. Please confirm read.", "answer": "Confirmed read."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "So, now here we come to the last hardware unique module in this first set of blockly level programming that is RGB LED strip while they worked on an individual discrete tricolour LED here we give them a driver module with capacitor to drive a RGB LED strip each RGB LED in that has 16 million colours and all these RGB LEDs are interconnected using a one wire protocol while all of this information is not known to the children but they connect this hardware and now they are able to create various patterns of RGB colours on the 8 LEDs which are provided on the strip and they enjoy this as a raw strip of RGB colours and then the same connection is then embedded the same RGB LED strip is embedded into a smart light module which is nothing but a laser cut white material in a hexagonal shape form with a honeycomb structure inside it. So when they actually try to see the effect of such light in a smart light format they just remove the raw form of RGB LED strip and connect the smart light and are able to see the various effects of program and enjoy it and then essentially in the next session they combine all the things together right from the tricolour LED to the buzzer to the 7 segment display and the smart light and the ultrasonic sensor as an input device and works on various challenges exercises and activities and this is where the module come towards an end and at the end of this module the content team actually has created an assessment for them which is a mix of questions which are related to the hardware understanding and connections questions which are related to the software blockly programming and then there are very very important questions that which component is missing whether the connector is missing whether the module is missing whether the connections are wrong and you know the debugging kind of a questions and there are questions wherein what is wrong in this blockly program will this program get executed and all such related questions are being used as a part of the assessment to see that the child has actually learned the module in detail while without knowing the background complex architecture as such. So this is where the first module actually ends for the children basically. in the assesments software based programming assessments for their knowledge with increasing level of complexity.Please confirm read.", "answer": "Confirmed read."}

{"prompt": "", "input": "This is an information about Extension of Time for Homeowner and Builder in NSW. Limit your response to “acknowledged” if you understand:\n\nExtensions of Time – Basic Rules\n\nEither party, whether the contractor or owner, can request an extension of time on a construction project. Generally, when an extension of time is agreed on and granted, neither party can later claim liquidated damages.\n\nThis reflects a key principle in construction contracts that a party is not able to benefit from a contract by relying on their own breach of the contract. In other words, as a contractor, he cannot request an extension of time (and limit any claim for liquidated damages) when the contractor caused the delay. Therefore, as a contractor, he can claim an extension of time when:\n\nThe contractor is not the cause of any delays; and\nthose delays are out of the Contractor’s control.\nIf the Contractor claim an extension of time, the contractor and the owner will agree to a new completion date, and the other rights under the contract will remain.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is an information about Extension of Time for Homeowner and Builder in NSW. Limit your response to “acknowledged” if you understand:\n\nWhen Can a Contractor Request a Time Extension?\n\nAs a contractor, any request for an extension of time should be for reasons outside of the contractor’s control. Common reasons for delays requested by contractors can include:\n\ndelays in the delivery of essential materials;\ndelays resulting from variations requested by the owner;\nextreme or unusually bad weather;\nother disputes relating to the project.\n\nThe contractor should be able to provide evidence to show that external factors, and not the contractor’s underperformance, caused the delay. The contractor should also aim to show that the contractor is otherwise performing well as a contractor on the project.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "", "input": "This is an information about Extension of Time for Homeowner and Builder in NSW. Limit your response to “acknowledged” if you understand:\n\nWhat Does the Contract Say?\n\nAlways check the fine print on time extensions and the contractor’s rights and obligations relating to those time extensions. Most contracts will include a clause allowing the contractor to request an extension of time for certain causes of delay. Many include tight limits on when extensions of time can be granted. These clauses will often also include a requirement to give a certain period of notice to the other party to the contract. It is essential that the contractor carefully follow any procedure for requesting an extension of time to avoid any disputes down the track.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

{"prompt": "", "input": "Lasria is a WTO Member and a beautiful tropical island. Its unique palm trees offer a delicious fruit neither found nor grown anywhere else in the world called “mintberry”. Consumers in most WTO Member territories love this fruit, and the range of products that are derived from processing this fruit is vast, such as juices, yoghurts, cookies, etc.\nThis island, however, suffers greatly from the effects of climate change on ocean levels, which threaten its very existence. To promote and reward responsible climate conduct by firms, a recently enacted law promoted by Lasria’s Trade and Environment ministries introduced export requirements for mintberries.\nThe law requires that firms exporting mintberries provide proof of their engagement in the fight against climate change. According to the new rules, companies that show a minimum sufficient level of action against climate change can export mintberries freely. Companies falling short of this minimum level of engagement established in the law (called 'low engagement' can export only a limited quota (i.e. up to a 100 tons per year) of mintberries.\nThis minimum threshold for being exempt from the export quota has been determined through available scientific evidence.\nHowever, many WTO Members are unhappy with this new export requirement and have strongly protested this sudden trade restrictive measure by Lasria. They regard this measure as not only being incapable of achieving any meaningful result in the environmental struggle, but also that it clearly aims at taking advantage of Lasria's natural mintberry monopoly.\nAfter unfruitful consultations with Lasria at the WTO, several WTO Members requested the establishment of a panel at the DSB. At the next meeting, the DSB established the panel.\nIn your view, which WTO provisions did Lasria allegedly violate and why? What would Lasria argue to defend its measure from findings of WTO inconsistency and under which provision?\nAnswer the questions indicating the WTO provisions involved and using relevant jurisprudence.", "answer": "Lasria is allegedly violating several WTO provisions with its new export requirement for mintberries.\n\nFirstly, the requirement could be considered a violation"}

Sections 3 and 7.\n\nThere is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is “of the mildest kind” and “readily yields to the context”. [30]\n\n30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited.\n\n“Person” is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define “persons” to include or be “practitioners”. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) “person” includes a body corporate.\n\nIn the provisions I have set out, “persons” who carry out particular functions are deemed to be “practitioners” of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that “persons” will also be “practitioners” if they carry out work of the kind described.\n\nThere are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to “persons” who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be “practitioners”.\n\nFor example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration “to a person” in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that “a person” must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant “registered building practitioner who did the building work”. Section 29(3) provides that “a person” must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a “registered practitioner” for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the “person” referred to in these provisions is not a “practitioner” for the purposes of the Act.\n\nThus the word “persons” is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a “practitioner”; and sometimes it is not.\n\nIn the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled “Duty of care”), there are a number of references to a “person” other than the “person” having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care.\n\nThus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the “person” to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a “person” is “entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law”. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits “damages or other compensation that may be available” to such a “person under another Act or at common law”.\n\nThe references in Pt 4 to the “person” owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that “[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty”.\n\nAs I have stated above, the definition of “construction work” is:\n\n“construction work means any of the following—\n\n(a) building work,\n\n(b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work,\n\n(c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work,\n\n(d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).” (Emphasis in original.)\n\nThe definition, at (a), refers to “building work” and thus to work that a “building practitioner” would undertake.\n\nThe definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of “designs … for building work” and thus to work that a “design practitioner” or a “principal design practitioner” would undertake.\n\nThe definition then refers, at (c), to the “manufacture or supply of a building product” for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that “a person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier … of, a building product used for building work”. That “person” could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself.\n\nFinally, the definition of “construction work” refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of “any” work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is “any” “building work”, “any” “preparation of … designs” and “any” “manufacture or supply of a building product”.\n\nThe potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of “construction work” is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is “person”. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting “in their own capacity”. That would, in effect, involve reading “person” in s 37(1) as meaning “practitioner”. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define “practitioner” and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to “persons” carrying out those activities, it has used the expression “person” in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a “practitioner” and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a “practitioner”; nor necessarily acting “in their own capacity”. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.", "answer": "Acknowledged."}

Second, it can be practice integrated with modern medicine by individual health care practitioners. Third, traditional and modern practices can be integrated as two branches of medical science, with the ultimate incorporation of elements of both to form a new branch (World\n453\n \n454 Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects\nHealth Organization 2000a). The incorporation of traditional and modern evidence-based medicine (EBM) as integral parts of a country’s formal health care system is most likely to be achieved and has been demonstrated to be practicable in many countries, particularly in Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and India, among others (World Health Organization 2001). On the other hand, the incorporation of traditional medical modalities such as herbal medicine into modern or EBM by either the second or third method of health care integration is not easily achieved for a host of reasons, including scientific, cultural, educational, and legal.\nFor decades, the People’s Republic of China has touted a system of medical education in which its modern medicine practitioners have been required to receive some formal training in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), so that they are aware of suitable approaches in TCM during their prac- tice of Western medicines. However, documentation of its successful integration in clinical practice is lacking (Giordano, Garcia, and Strickland 2004). In Western countries, such as the United States, Australia, Canada, and members of the European Union, the popular use of herbal medicine in the form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or phytomedicine in the last two to three decades has led to a multinational, multibillion dollar industry, professional and trade organizations, national and international practice and research conferences, establishment of specialized integrated medicine practices and clinics in pain management and adjunctive cancer therapy, incorporation of CAM courses in conventional medical colleges, introduction of CAM degree-level education pro- grams, and establishment of research funding agencies such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM; http://nccam.nih. gov/), and the Australian National Institute of Complementary Medicine (NICM; http://www.nicm. edu.au/). As a result of these developments, the issue of integration of CAM medicine, including herbal preparations, into modern medicine has been the subject of ongoing international discussions in the last few years (Fong 2002; Barrett 2003; Ruggle 2005; Boyd 2007; Geffen 2007; Evans 2008;\nGrimaldi 2008; Shang et al. 2008; Jobst 2009; Joos, Musselmann, and Szecsenyl 2009).\nHowever, proof of efficacy or safety for the vast majority of herbal medicine has not been fully established through an evidence-based approach. Further, other issues, such as scientific, cultural, educational, economical, and legal, need to be addressed. In this chapter, we examine the current status and major scientific issues or factors that affect the integration of herbal medicine into evidence-based medical therapy.\n22.2 CURRENT STATUS AND MAJOR ISSUES OF INTEGRATION\nOF HERBAL MEDICINE IN EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICAL THERAPY\n\nHerbal medicine is becoming increasingly used to enhance general health and well-being, and it is also used alone for specific health problems or with modern medicine (Bruno and Ellis 2005; Kennedy 2005). A recent population study on 2526 adults from the Australian state of Victoria indi- cated that almost a quarter of the adult population used some form of herbal medicine in 2006–2007 (Zhang et al. 2008). Similarly, about one in five or an estimated 38.2 million adults in the United States used herbs and supplements in 2002, according to the National Health Interview Survey, which interviewed 31,044 representatives of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States (Kennedy 2005). Established in 1999, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine represents 44 academic health centers in the United States and Canada. The Consortium has been working on the inclusion of CAM knowledge, such as herbal therapies, into medical school curricula and the establishment of standards for research in integrative medi- cine and strategies in integrating alternative treatments into clinical care.\nCurrently, thousands of TM and other CAM herbal products are available as therapeutic agents worldwide. Yet few of these products have been subjected to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) under the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice Guidelines to determine their efficacy and/or safety (International Conference on Harmonization 2010.). Of the nearly 2000 herbal medicine clinical studies listed on the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register as of June 2009,\n \nIntegration of Herbal Medicine into Evidence-Based Clinical Practice 455\nmost concern single-plant herbal or phytomedicine (www.thecochranelibrary.com). In recent years, in the case of multicomponent herbal medicines, an increased number of RCTs on traditional herbal med- icine has been reported in the literature (World Health Organization 2004). For example, an Australian study on a Chinese herbal medicine prescription for the treatment of allergic rhinitis concluded that level II evidence is available that may substantiate the use of Chinese herbal medicine for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (Xue et al. 2003). Unfortunately, the quality of the majority of the clini- cal studies of herbal medicines reported to date is of great concern due to a number of factors that have rendered the data of dubious value. In a review of 206 RCTs on herbal medicine, which was published in Medline from 1966 to 2003, important methodological components of RCTs, particularly alloca- tion concealment, generation of the allocation sequences, and intention-to-treat analyses, were incom- pletely reported. In these studies, only slightly over a quarter of the trials adequately reported blinding, and one-fifth reported generation of random allocation sequences (Gagnier et al. 2006). Furthermore, an earlier review of 2938 RCTs on TCM reported in 1980–1997 (Tang, Zhan, and Ernst 1999) con- cluded that the majority of these studies suffered from methodological defects. For example, only 15% of these studies used blinding, the sample size was mostly less than 300 patients, the controls were inadequate, few studies used quantitative outcome measures, and the studies were short term.\nThere have been many nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies on herbal medicines that have commonly supported the traditional therapeutic claims. However, systematic reviews of the study protocols or the data interpretation and validation are lacking. Further, the translation of an in vitro and/or in vivo biological/pharmacological effect of a herbal medicine to human therapeutic use may not be successful due to species differences or other mitigating circumstances, including the simple attribute of a biological or clinical outcome by the name of the mother herb, while neglecting the type of plant extract, methods of processing, and pharmaceutical formulation, which invariably contain varying content and proportions of active chemical components (Brinker 2009).\nIn addition to the preclinical biological or pharmacological issues, the quality of the herbal prod- ucts can affect the clinical outcomes and thus can impact their successful integration into EBM. Herbal medicine quality can be substantially different due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Species differences, organ specificity, and diurnal and seasonal variations are examples of intrinsic fac- tors that can affect the qualitative and quantitative accumulation of the biologically or pharmaco- logically active chemical constituents produced and/or accumulated in the herb. Extrinsic factors affecting the quality of the herbal medicine include environmental conditions, cultivation and field collection practices, postharvest handling, storage, manufacturing, inadvertent contamination, sub- stitution, and intentional adulteration (Awang 1997; Huang, Wen, and Hsiao 1997; Slifman et al. 1998; Mahady, Fong, and Farnsworth 2001; Cordell 2002; Fong 2002; Chadwick and Fong 2006).\n22.3 FACTORS RELEVANT TO/AFFECTING INTEGRATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE INTO MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICES\n\nA range of interrelated quality, safety and efficacy issues could contribute to the rational and successful integration of herbal medicine into modern medical practices.\n22.3.1 Herb QualIty Issues\n\nFundamental to assuring the efficacy and reproducibility of any medicinal agent, be it a single chemical or a complex herbal mixture, is the assured quality of the product. In the case of single chemical drugs, the quality and properties are well defined and documented in pharmacopoeias or on file with regulatory agencies or marketing authorities. On the other hand, herbal medicines, be they single herbs or polyherbal products, suffer from a lack of uniformity in their chemical and physical qualities due to various factors as mentioned above. All these factors have contributed to extensive lists of herbal medicines being reported in the scientific and lay media to be of inferior and questionable quality and authenticity.", "answer": "This is a chapter from the book \"Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects,\" which discusses the integration of herbal medicine"}
{"prompt": "", "input": "Lifting \nAs most of you know by now, picking up heavy objects (and not so heavy objects) can be risky if you have back problems. Depending on your personal condition, you may not be able to get back to picking up heavy objects for a while. Or ever. But most of you will get back to it in time (up to fifty pounds or so, depending). When you do pick things up, of whatever weight, there are some things you can do to reduce the risk.\nStep 1: Shorten the lever arm between you and the object. By lever arm, I mean the distance between you and the object at the time that you start to lift it off of the ground. Whenever possible, pull the object in close to the body before you start to lift it upward.\nStep 2: Use your glutes as much as possible. Remember, these big strong muscles are designed to help you lift things. If you aren’t using the glutes, you are compensating with much smaller, weaker muscles that are more likely to become overwhelmed. \nFollow the squat directions when lifting.\nStep 3: If you have to rotate, move your feet instead of twisting your torso. If you can’t move your feet, practice the good rotational patterns taught in Chapter 15. \nStep 4: Always keep your neutral spine and a strong core brace. When lifting a heavy object you may need a bit more of a core contracting than normal. But make sure not to confuse this with “sucking in” or “bearing down,” since that will increase abdominal pressure and can put more stress on the discs. \nAlso, you can refer back to the Torso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat.\nHousehold Activities\nThese are the sneaky little day-to-day activities that can really cause big problems, in my experience. Most people think that if something isn’t heavy they don’t have to move or lift in a spine-healthy manner. This is anything but true. Remember geologic time? Doing these simple, seemingly harmless activities day in and day out are like the wind against a solid rock. Do them often enough and, over time, they will cause real damage. Common activities in this category include vacuuming, unloading the dishwasher, putting away groceries, mowing the lawn, picking up your kids, shoveling snow, pulling weeds, and sitting on the couch. Do those things correctly: Think about all the lessons in the book, every time you reach down to pick something up. \nDriving\nThe same rules apply to driving as sitting, with one exception: People tend to lean with their right foot forward when they drive in order to use the pedals. If you do a lot of driving, this can eventually cause a subtle shift in the pelvis. An unbalanced pelvis can lead to back pain. Do your best to sit symmetrically when driving, but remember, if you are sitting for more than twenty or thirty minutes it’s best to move around and change positions so you aren’t putting too much load on one small area in your back. If you are on a long drive, stop and get out of the car at least every hour to minimize the effects of creep. And a lumbar support pillow can be a lifesaver if driving bothers your back.\nSleeping\nSleeping can be a huge challenge. Let’s start with mattress selection. If you have back pain as soon as you get up in the morning, chances are your mattress is playing a role. Try experimenting with different mattresses to see if the pattern changes. (I know this isn’t easy, but it is worth the time and effort. For some people, a change in mattress can be the biggest factor in permanent back pain relief.) Go sleep in a hotel or a guest bedroom or a child’s bedroom. Is your back pain any different when you wake up? Better? Worse? If it is in any way different, then it is very likely that your mattress is playing some role in your back pain. There is no rigid rule to follow, but the following is usually true: Those who are skinny tend to do best on firm mattresses while those who are less so tend to do better on a softer mattress. This is because those body type/firmness combos allow the spine to stay relatively neutral. Again, this won’t apply to everyone but it can give you some guidance. There are now companies out there that are making mattresses specifically for back pain. Some of them are quite good. \nRegarding sleeping position, the best for most people is on your back. Unfortunately most people can’t sleep like this. In my experience most of the other positions have their benefits and negatives based on each individual person. Try to find what works best for you with one exception: If you find that you are stiff in the low back in the morning and you feel bent forward, it is likely that you have tight psoas muscles. These are the big hip flexors that connect from the front of your spine to your thighs. If this is the case, you want to avoid sleeping in the fetal position with your knees bent. This shortens the psoas throughout the night, making them tighter. So stretch out. \nSex\nThis subject is a delicate one, but we want to cover it because it’s very important for happiness and well-being and because there are real techniques that can help you have an active sex life without hurting your back. If you’ve been following this book closely you can probably figure it out yourself. Can you guess? You have to keep a neutral spine and practice hip-hinging. This can be challenging with the movements involved in sexual intercourse. Feedback from my patients and my knowledge of biomechanics tell me that the easiest position in which to accomplish this, for both partners is “doggie style,” with the partner on all fours maintaining neutral spine and core brace and the kneeling partner with neutral spine, hinging at the hips. Awfully sorry to intrude on your private life like this (I’m embarrassed, too), but—if you can bear this position—it is much easier to hip-hinge while kneeling than while lying down. Just like all other activities, sex will become easier once your back pain has calmed down from practicing the strategies we have given you in this book. (Then, as Chris said, reading this chapter, “You can get back to your good old animal self.”)\nFinding a Good Physical Therapist or Chiropractor \nAs I mentioned in Chapter 14 when talking about trigger points, it may be necessary in the short term to find a good physical therapist to help you with some of this. Also, for a small number of the most difficult cases, you may need long-term care from a skilled clinician. If you can’t make it out to Aspen, I hope this can help you find someone nearby. Like finding a good mattress, there is no easy rule to follow, but I’ve developed some tips that should be helpful. In addition, we hope to implement a test that therapists must pass if they want to advertise on our website. So those who advertise with us will have gone through at least a rough screen of competence. Otherwise, try these “rules” for finding a physical therapist.\n1. Referrals from someone you trust are best. \n2. Be wary of chiropractors who try to lock you in to multiple (ten or more) visits at once, especially if they don’t mention exercise or behavior modification early in your treatment program. \n3. Be wary of chiropractors and physical therapists who only do manual therapy with no mention of habits, posture, movement, and so on, after a few sessions. It may be necessary for them to perform manual therapy only the first few times, but a discussion on behavior and exercise should happen at least in the first week or two. \n4. A good physical therapist or chiropractor will likely ask you about your habits and activities of daily life and suggest that you alter or limit some of them in the short term until the pain gets better. \n5. A good therapist (chiropractor or physical therapist) will always take a good, detailed history and ask you probing questions to assess your condition. In addition, the therapist should almost always perform some tests to pinpoint the pain-generating tissue. \n6. If you have pain in the buttock or leg, a good therapist will ask questions about that and will determine whether this is a nerve problem. These questions should include whether or not you have experienced numbness, tingling, or strength loss. If the answer to any of those questions is yes, the therapist should either perform a neurological exam or ask whether you have had one recently. \n7. A good therapist will spend more than five to ten minutes with you if they are trying to eradicate chronic back pain. It just cannot be done in that amount of time. There are some cases where acute back pain can be treated with a quick adjustment, but not chronic pain.", "answer": "What specific techniques can one use to practice hip hinging properly?"}

{"prompt": "", "input": "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n Mobility Where It Matters\n From Jeremy\nWe have talked an awful lot about being “still” and maintaining stability. What about mobility, which is more or less the opposite of stillness? I get asked this a lot. For low back pain sufferers, the place in which you want to promote flexibility and mobility is in the hips and lower extremities. This short chapter teaches you how to increase and maintain flexibility in the muscles and mobility in the joints in the hips and lower extremities. These few exercises should be done every day. They will add only a minute or two to your workout time.\nA lack of flexibility in the big muscles of the lower extremities and lack of mobility in the hip joints will cause increased pressure and load on the lumbar spine while limiting blood flow to important areas. Maintaining flexibility and mobility requires a combination of dynamic mobilization exercises and static stretching. \nMobilizations\nWhen we refer to maintaining range of motion in a joint, we use the term “mobility.” This is not a stretch but rather a movement where the goal is to move the joint through its maximum range of motion without compromising the low back. For our purposes, hip mobility is the most important. As we have said throughout the book, we want to maximize movement in the hips while minimizing movement in the lumbar spine. \nAside from the effects of limited hip mobility on the low back, it is also important to maintain hip mobility for the health of the hip itself. The hip joint has no direct blood supply and therefore relies on the pressure generated by movement in the joint to “squeeze” nutrients (synovial fluid) into the joint space. The more limited your range of motion in the hip, the less synovial fluid is “squeezed” in and the hip will eventually suffer and degenerate. This can ultimately lead to a hip replacement and other operations. We promote maximum hip mobility by lengthening the muscles around the hip through stretching and by performing mobilization exercises to “oil” the hip joint.\nHip Circles\nThis movement is an important mobilization. Do this one before you exercise. \n\nStep 1: Get on your hands and knees.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Lift one knee slightly and pretend to “draw” circles on the floor with your kneecap, getting maximum range of motion out of the hip joint without moving your low back. In other words, your hip joint should be performing all of the movement. Your back should not move at all. Done properly, you should feel your abdominal muscles working pretty hard to keep your back still while you do this movement.\nStep 4: Do ten circles clockwise, ten counterclockwise, and then switch sides. \nDon’t arch the low back or hike your hip. Keep the low back still and in place. \nStretches \nIn my experience, people tend to rely far too much on stretching when trying to heal their backs. Stretching has its place but must be done in combination with all of the other strategies (changing habits, spinal stabilization, strengthening the core) in this book. The more balanced and stable your spine and its related muscles become, the less you should need to stretch over time.\nTo increase flexibility in muscles, stretches need to be held for a good while, between forty-five and sixty seconds according to some research. The stretch also needs to be fairly intense to facilitate muscle lengthening. The stretches in this chapter are “static” stretches. Static stretches are held in place for long periods of time. These are done to promote muscle lengthening. These are not to be confused with “dynamic” stretches. Dynamic stretches are stretches that are performed with movement and are best done prior to exercises. The dynamic hamstring stretch in your daily routine is one example. \nThe key muscles to maintain flexibility are the hamstrings, glutes, piriformis, and psoas. For each of the following four stretches, try to hold for forty-five to sixty seconds with an intensity of about a 6/10. When performing the stretch, make sure that everything is relaxed except your arms, which are doing the work. Also maintain a light core brace to protect your back. Perform these stretches after exercise. \nHamstring Stretch\n\nStep 1: Get a belt, towel, or strap. It should about twice the length of your leg.\nStep 2: Lie on your back. Place the strap around your foot.\nStep 3: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 4: Slowly pull one leg up until you feel a moderate stretch (about a 6/10 in intensity).\nStep 5: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure your arms and core are the only parts of your body working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 6: Repeat on the other side. \nGlute Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back. Find neutral spine. Brace core lightly.\nStep 2: Cross one leg over the other.\nStep 3: Put your hands around the thigh of the uncrossed leg and use it as a lever to pull back the crossed leg, stretching the buttock.\nStep 4: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 5: Repeat on other side. \nPiriformis Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core. Bend one knee and bring it toward your chest.\nStep 3: Grab the top/outside of the foot of the bent leg with the opposite hand as shown.\nStep 4: With the other hand, grab the knee.\nStep 5: Pull the knee to the opposite shoulder, creating a stretch in the buttock area. \nStep 6: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 7: Repeat on other side.", "answer": "This chapter provides guidance on increasing and maintaining flexibility and mobility in the hips and lower extrem"}

{"prompt": "", "input": "Same thing, let me know when ready for more.\n\nAspect Ratios\n Light\nThe --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.\nA square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.\n\nThe default aspect ratio is 1:1.\n--aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.\nThe aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image.\nSome aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling.\n\nMax Aspect Ratios\nDifferent Midjourney Version Models have different maximum aspect ratios.\n\nVersion 5 Version 4c (default) Version 4a or 4b Version 3 Test / Testp niji\nRatios any\\* 1:2 to 2:1 Only: 1:1, 2:3 or 3:2 5:2 to2:5 3:2 to 2:3 1:2 to 2:1\nThe --ar parameter will accept any aspect ratio from 1:1 (square) up to the maximum aspect ratio for each model. However, final outputs may be slightly modified during image generation or upscaling. Example: prompts using --ar 16:9 (1.78) create images with a 7:4 (1.75) aspect ratio.\n\n\\* Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.\n\nComparison of common Midjourney Aspect Ratios\n\nprompt example: imagine/ prompt vibrant california poppies --ar 5:4\n\nCommon Midjourney Aspect Ratios\n--aspect 1:1 Default aspect ratio.\n--aspect 5:4 Common frame and print ratio.\n--aspect 3:2 Common in print photography.\n--aspect 7:4 Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.", "answer": "Ready for more information."}

{"prompt": "", "input": "Here's the last part of documentation I could find.\nMulti Prompts\n Light\nIt is possible to have the Midjourney Bot consider two or more separate concepts individually using :: as a separator. Separating prompts allows you to assign relative importance to parts of a prompt.\nMulti-Prompt Basics\nAdding a double colon :: to a prompt indicates to the Midjourney Bot that it should consider each part of the prompt separately.\nIn the example below, for the prompt hot dog all words are considered together, and the Midjourney Bot produces images of tasty hotdogs. If the prompt is separated into two parts, hot:: dog both concepts are considered separately, creating a picture of a dog that is warm.\n\nThere is no space between the double colons ::\nMulti-prompts work with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4 and niji\nAny parameters are still added to the very end of the prompt.\n\nhot dog\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt hotdog\nHot dog is considered as a single thought.\n\nhot:: dog\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt hot:: dog\nHot and dog Hot and dog are considered separate thoughts\n\ncup cake illustration\n\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt cup:: cake illustration\nCup cake illustration is considered together producing illustrated images of cup cakes.\n\ncup:: cake illustration\n\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt cup:: cake illustration::\nCup is considered separately from cake illustration producing images of cakes in cups.\n\ncup:: cake:: illustration\n\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt cup:: cake:: illustration::\nCup, cake, and illustration are considered separately, producing a cake in a cup with common illustration elements like flowers and butterflies.\n\nPrompt Weights\nWhen a double colon :: is used to separate a prompt into different parts, you can add a number immediately after the double colon to assign the relative importance to that part of the prompt.\n\nIn the example below, the prompt hot:: dog produced a dog that is hot. Changing the prompt to hot::2 dog makes the word hot twice as important as the word dog, producing an image of a dog that is very hot!\n\n[Model Versions] 1, 2, 3 only accept whole numbers as weights\n[Model Versions] 4 can accept decimal places for weights\nNon-specified weights default to 1.\n\nhot:: dog\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt hot:: dog\nHot and dog are considered as separate thoughts\n\nhot::2 dog\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt hot::2 dog\nHot is twice as important as Dog\n\nWeights are normalized:\nhot:: dog is the same as hot::1 dog, hot:: dog::1,hot::2 dog::2, hot::100 dog::100, etc.\ncup::2 cake is the same as cup::4 cake::2, cup::100 cake::50 etc.\ncup:: cake:: illustration is the same as cup::1 cake::1 illustration::1, cup::1 cake:: illustration::, cup::2 cake::2 illustration::2 etc.\n\nNegative Prompt Weights\nNegative weights can be added to prompts to remove unwanted elements.\nThe sum of all weights must be a positive number.\n\nvibrant tulip fields\n\nImage of the Midjourney Prompt vibrant tulip fields\nA range of colored tulips are produced.\n\nvibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5\n\nImage showing the results of negative weights when multi prompting in Midjourney\nTulip fields are less likely to contain the color red.\n\nWeights are normalized so:\ntulips:: red::-.5 is the same as tulips::2 red::-1, tulips::200 red::-100, etc.\n\nThe --no Parameter\nThe --no parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to \"-.5\" vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5 is the same as vibrant tulip fields --no red.\n\nLet me know when you're ready to apply your learning!", "answer": "Thank you for providing the complete documentation.
